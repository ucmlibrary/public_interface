The aboriginal peoples who created this artwork have a very long history in the region. In North America, specifically in California and the surrounding region, archaeological evidence suggests that settlement began in the Paleoindian period (approximately 12,000-8,000 YBP, or \u201cyears before present\u201d), with the greatest use of the area occurring 2,600 to 1,000 YBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to know when the sites in these particular images were created, because currently there are few techniques for dating rock art. Generally speaking, rock paintings in unprotected environments (like boulder faces) are thought to be less than 500 years old because they are exposed to wind and rain. But carved designs in hard rock like granite are durable and can last for thousands of years in a stable environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Meaning</h3>\r\n<p>Native American rock art provides us with many clues in our search for the history of California\u2019s aboriginal peoples. The painted or carved symbols are not writing, as we know it, but they were created to convey information. Their meanings are not always known, and are sometimes debated among scholars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rock art can range from simple scratch marks to elaborate motifs. Some common abstract design elements include circles, concentric circles, spirals, dots, and meandering lines. Representative designs include human forms and animals. Human forms with horns or radiating wavy lines and animals such as the lizard and rattlesnake are thought to be symbols of power or spirit helpers. This image is thought to be a representation of a medicine bag, and this one clearly resembles a human hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ethnographic information has suggested that rock art served several functions. Some rock art styles could be boundary markers for clan territories or guides to water and food resources. Others, like this example, may record historical events such as astronomical phenomena or the arrival of Spanish explorers. It has been determined that some rock paintings were made as part of girls\u2019 puberty ceremonies; designs most commonly thought to be related include red diamond chains and chevrons. Some rock art motifs resemble the visionary imagery of trance states, which Native American shamans entered to communicate with the spirit world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Types</h3>\r\n<p>Rock art is characterized by how it was created and the materials that comprise it. Major types include the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Petroglyphs</h4>\r\n<p>Petroglyphs are rock engravings produced by pecking (striking the surface of the rock with a harder small stone), chiseling (using a hammer stone to pound a sharp stone chisel), abraiding (rubbing or battering the rock surface with a rounded stone), or scratching (using a very sharp edged stone to scratch finer lines).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cDesert varnish,\u201d a reddish brown or black mineral patina that forms on rock surfaces in the desert, creates a perfect medium for petroglyphs. Designs such as this one were etched through the patina to reveal the lighter rock beneath. Desert varnish forms very slowly\u20141,000 years for a heavy varnish\u2014and becomes thicker and darker with increasing age.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Cupules</h4>\r\n<p>Cupules, a type of petroglyph, are small, cup-shaped indentations. They are pecked or ground into the stone and appear randomly or sometimes in lines or groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Pictographs</h4>\r\n<p>Pictographs are designs painted on rock surfaces with paints made from natural mineral pigments mixed with animal fats, egg whites, plant oils, or urine to bind them. Hematite (iron oxide) was used for red paints, limonite for yellow, kaolin clays for white, and charcoal for black. Paints were applied with brushes made from yucca fiber or applied with fingers and hands. The most common color in southern California is red.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Geoglyphs (Intaglios)</h4>\r\n<p>Geoglyphs, also known as intaglios, are giant drawings on the ground that depict geometric designs, human forms, and animal figures. These large designs were created by clearing the dark rock of desert pavements and exposing the lighter colored rock and sand below. Many of these figures were made over the last 2,000 years. More than 200 geoglyphs have been discovered along the Colorado River, and many others have been reported around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Natural Deterioration</h3>\r\n<p>Natural elements such as rain, wind, heat, and cold have had their effect on Native American rock art. Pigments have worn away and mineralization has re-patinated surfaces, rendering the images ever fainter. Heat and cold have caused crumbling and exfoliation while falling rocks have broken away designs from their original locations. Plants taking root in cracks, lichen growth, and mosses covering surfaces eventually break down rock and its images. This image shows a rock\u2014and, as a result, a design\u2014that has broken apart due to natural deterioration. Nevertheless, it is remarkable how well many of the symbols and designs made thousands of years ago have survived.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Vandalism and Destruction</h3>\r\n<p>While the effects of nature on rock art images are sad to see and result in great cultural loss, nothing is as devastating as the damage done by humans. This destruction takes many forms; sometimes it is inadvertent but often it is intentional. Many images have survived wind, rain, and storms for thousands of years only to fall victim to vandalism. For example, graffiti and bullet holes obfuscate and can potentially destroy a design. Because they are located on large swaths of ground, geoglyphs have also been negatively impacted by illegal motorcycles, SUVs, and off-highway vehicle activities.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "uploads/rock-art.jpg", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Native Americans In the 19th Century", "slug": "native-americans-19th-century", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "###The Mission System and Spanish Rule\r\nBy 1823, Spaniards had founded 21 missions from San Diego to Sonoma. The mission system was Spain's centuries-old method of advancing and securing its colonial frontiers. Spain used natives to colonize new lands and provide a labor force to sustain its colonies. Two lithographs show European impressions of native Californian dancers in missions in San Francisco and San Jose.\r\n\r\nThe mission padres used force to obtain converts and labor. For example, the Spanish friars would allow Native Americans to escape or \"visit\" their homes, with the intention of following them and capturing other indigenous people. Motivated by curiosity and self-interest, many native Californians joined Spanish missions and villages, only to discover they were not permitted to leave.\r\n\r\nNative Americans were pressed into labor, working all day, serving as farm labor and domestic servants. The lithograph Vue du Presidio de San Francisco shows native people doing work under the supervision of Spaniards in the Presidio of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nNative women were often raped by Spanish soldiers and other settlers. The natives were severely disciplined for not working, but most often for attempting escape.\r\n\r\n### Life on the Ranchos\r\n\r\nSecularization began in 1834, with half of all mission lands to be turned over to local native groups. But native Californians were often never told that they owned land, and many drifted away, strangers in their own ancestral homelands.\r\n\r\nNative Californians provided most of the labor for the emergent Spanish ranching economy. Some worked as vaqueros herding cattle. The lithograph California Vaqueros, Home from the Chase pictures these is Spanish cowboys, some of whom may be of natives. Others processed tallow in huge iron pots, tended gardens, and harvested crops.\r\n\r\nLaborers were bound to their ranches in a state of perpetual peonage, with difficult working conditions and few alternatives. In response, some natives fled inland, joining mountain or desert groups and using their ranching knowledge to organize raids on livestock.\r\n\r\nDisplacement and depopulation contributed to an intense process of what anthropologists call \u201cethnogenesis,\u201d the creation of new ethnicities and identities. Native groups combined, split apart, and recombined in new ways in response to perilous times. Spanish-speaking natives intermarried with working-class Mexicans, further blurring racial categories.\r\n\r\n### The Gold Rush Era and Beyond\r\n\r\nThe Gold Rush further devastated California's native groups. The state's native population dropped from about 150,000 in 1848 to 30,000 just 12 years later. Miners and other newcomers methodically mined, hunted, and logged native groups' most remote hiding places. The print A Road Scene in California depicts European American miners moving into an area, as a native group walks the other direction. The photograph of a \"mining scene with flume and miners\" seems to show an Indian in the foreground.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lithograph of \"California gold diggers\" shows Indians and white miners coexisting, these were not peaceful times. In response to the invasion of their territory, natives began raiding mining camps for subsistence. American miners \u2014 supported by the state government \u2014 organized war parties and sometimes slaughtered entire native groups.\r\n\r\nEven as the native populations dwindled, paintings such as Carl Wimar's Indian Campfire continued to idealize a life that had almost disappeared. Photographs from this time, such as \"Group of Digger Indian Squaws,\" \"Washoe Indians \u2014 Valley of Lake Tahoe,\" and \"Washoe Indians \u2014 The Chief\u2019s Family,\" show Indians in Western dress, their traditional way of life disrupted.\r\n\r\nThe Act for the Government and Protection of Indians was passed by the state legislature in 1850. It denied native Californians the right to testify in court and allowed white Americans and Californios to keep natives as indentured servants. According to the National Park Service, an 1862 issue of the Alta California reported: \"Little more than a hundred miles from San Francisco, in Mendocino County, the practice of Indian stealing is still extensively carried out. Only recently, George H. Woodman was caught near Ukiah with sixteen Indian children, as he was about to take them out of the county for sale.\"\r\n\r\n### The Late 19th Century\r\n\"I do not like the white man because he is a liar and a thief,\" Isidora Filomena de Solano, a Patwin-speaking woman from the Bay Area, told an interviewer in 1874. She echoed the sentiments of many native Californians struggling to preserve traditional ways in the midst of holocaust. Indeed, under American rule Native Americans basically had no legal recourse to fight discrimination or the dispossession of their lands.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1870s, two significant events occurred. One was the Ghost Dance movement, which sought to restore native traditions. The other was the Modoc War of 1872-73, a series of battles between US soldiers and Modoc Indians near Tule Lake. These hard fought battles, which the Modoc eventually lost, were the last known time Indians in California resisted government authorities. The US Army asked photographer Eadward Muybridge to document the wars. His stereoscopic views purport to show both sides of the battle: \"A Modoc Brave on the Warpath\" on the native side, and \"Warm Spring Indian Scouts on Picket Duty\" under the Army's command.\r\n\r\nSome native people, such as the \"Indian Family at Santa Rosa Rancheria near Lemoor,\" shown here, lived in rancherias \u2014 a word that originally meant the workers' quarters on a rancho, and later came to refer to Indian settlements that were less formal than reservations. The print Yosemite Rancheria shows one such community of Indians camped near a river in 1878, six years after Yosemite had become a national park. Many rancherias still exist in California today.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 19th century, the native Californian population had dropped to less than 20,000 as a result of disease, malnourishment, and violence. Less than half lived on reservations \u2014 most found work in California cities or in migratory agriculture (many found seasonal work in Southern California\u2019s wine industry.) There were few jobs open in the cities, and Native Americans often were not paid honestly. The cover of an 1895 issue of The Wasp, a satirical magazine of the time, illustrates some attitudes towards \"Uncle Sam's Indian Policy,\" which the magazine's editors considered ineffectual.", "render_as": "M", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "uploads/19th-century.jpeg", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "Native Americans in Pre-Columbian California - 18th Century", "slug": "native-americans-pre-columbian-california-18th-cen", "blockquote": "More than 200 different native tribes \u2014 about 300,000 people \u2014 once made up the population of the land that is today the state of California.", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "### Where They Lived\r\n\r\nDiverse in culture and way of life, they lived in hundreds of small, politically autonomous communities up and down the state, connected by trade and kinship networks. Two maps show the general range of these tribes throughout the entire area. The map of Pomo linguistic stock shows many dialect variations and village sites, demonstrating the complexity of language variations in just one tribal group.\r\n\r\n### How They Lived\r\n\r\nMost California native communities consisted of between 200 and 500 people. Boundaries were general. Nomadic groups tended to have greater social and gender equality, while more sedentary groups had hierarchical social classes with a wide gulf between rich and poor.\r\n\r\nAlthough artwork by European artists depicts some aspects of California Indian life, we have no images from pre-Columbian California. The lithographs shown here, by Russian artist Ludwig Choris, were based on sketches he created during a visit to California in 1816 \u2014 long after their traditional way of life had been disrupted.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to get glimpses of their lives, but it is impossible to know how these tribes really looked and lived, as opposed to how they were viewed through European eyes. For example, because native groups usually altered the landscape in a way that mimicked nature, Europeans mistakenly assumed natives lived in an untouched \"wilderness.\" But whether they lived in mountains, valleys, deserts, forests, or beaches, native peoples continually managed their environment, tending and cultivating the land through controlled burnings, weeding, pruning, tilling, irrigation, and selective replanting.\r\n\r\n### Basketry\r\n\r\nWe do know that elaborate basketry was an integral component of Native Californian culture and subsistence. Baskets were both beautiful and functional. They varied greatly by shape and size based on their function, be it for gathering food, sifting acorn meal, storing tobacco, gambling, cooking, and even transporting water. Native Californians could weave so tightly that their baskets held boiling water \u2014 heated by hot rocks \u2014 without leaking.\r\n\r\nAlthough the images shown here do not include baskets from pre-Columbian times, these traditional baskets suggest the wide range of shapes, patterns, and types of baskets made by native women. Two photographs taken in Yosemite National Park during the 1930s and 1940s show Lucy Telles, a famous basketmaker also known as Pa-ma-has (1885-1955). Telles was of Yosemite Miwok and Mono Lake Paiute descent. She often worked in the park, demonstrating native basket-making techniques for tourists. One photograph shows her working on her largest basket; the other shows her seated amidst 10 other baskets, possibly all made by her.", "render_as": "M", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "uploads/pre-18th-century.jpeg", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Native Americans 20th Century and Today", "slug": "native-americans-20th-century-and-today", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "###Adaptation and Tradition\r\nAfter the low point of 1900, California's Indian population slowly began to increase as native communities adapted old ways to new circumstances. The number of Native Americans living in California rose steadily after 1900, reversing the appalling decline of the previous century. It is important to note that much of this increase was a result of relocation programs that encouraged Indians from other states to move to California.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 20th century, reformers struggled to raise public awareness of Indian poverty and to dispel myths of the permanently \"vanishing Indian.\" Native Americans were forced to make difficult choices about how to best maintain traditional ways to survive.\r\n\r\nThe anonymous families in the 1902 and 1903 photographs; the image of Chief Chepah and his wife, son, and daughter-in-law; the schoolgirls in the 1907 photographs; and the children at the Mission San Diego del Alcala school all illustrate this assimilation. The images \"Yuki Indian head\" and \"Captain John,\" and the photographs of various groups of Indian dancers, illustrate a pull in the opposite direction: to maintain traditions.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1910s, a native man named Ishi \u2014 believed to be the last survivor of his group, the Yahi \u2014 allowed University of California anthropologist A. L. Kroeber and others to study and interview him. During this time, Ishi lived with Kroeber and his family, and his obvious resiliency and intelligence challenged popular racist stereotypes. Photographs show Ishi in a variety of ways: dressed in a Western suit, seated in a chair; skinning the head of a deer in a traditional way; meeting other Indians; and flaking an arrow point. He also posed with Kroeber and Sam Batwi, a Northern/Central Yana Indian who served as an interpreter.\r\n\r\nThe early 20th century also saw Native Californians employing the legal system to fight for land rights, educational opportunities, and citizenship rights. In 1917, the California Supreme Court awarded Native Californians the right to vote, paving the way for the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act granting full citizenship.\r\n\r\n###Social Change and Self Determination\r\nBy the mid 1960s due to the influx of native americans through relocation from other states, there was a significant increase in indian urban populations. Those who did comprised California\u2019s most disadvantaged group, with higher unemployment rates than any other minority. Urban Indians fared better but still experienced limited educational and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe 1960s and 70s were years of social change for many groups. Beginning in the 1960s, Native Americans in California formed pan-Indian organizations such as the American Indian Historical Society, California Rural Indian Health Board, and California Indian Education Association to advocate for native rights. A group of activists called Indians of All Tribes occupied Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay from 1969 to 1971, part of a nationwide Native American social justice movement that continues today. One photograph from this era shows demonstrators marching against anti-Indian legislation. The anonymous poster The Longest Walk and Manuel Diaz's 200 Years of Misery illustrate the sentiments of these groups.\r\n\r\nThe American Indian Movement (AIM) was established with the goal of pushing the US government to redress the loss of lands and the breaking of several treaties. AIM also called for the recognition and protection of indigenous culture and religions and the affirmation of health, housing, employment, economic development, and educational opportunities for Native Americans.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1980s, the Cabazon and Morongo Bands of Mission Indians began offering card games and bingo on their reservations, setting off a controversy over gaming that would culminate in a 1987 US Supreme Court decision affirming Native Americans' right to build casinos on reservation lands. By 2005, there were 55 Native American casinos in California bringing tribes a total annual income of more than $3.5 billion.\r\n\r\nThese revenues have dramatically changed the economic, political, and social landscapes of California's native peoples. Because only groups that have been federally recognized as official tribes can build casinos, an enormous financial gulf now separates recognized and unrecognized native groups. Those groups with federal recognition enjoy considerable political clout, while members of unrecognized groups continue to suffer from joblessness, under-education, and poor living conditions. Money from gaming has also generated controversies over Indian identity as federally recognized groups have been forced to reconsider who can and cannot claim membership. Gaming has brought new wealth to some of California's Native Americans, but it has also brought new divisions, contentions, and self-definitions.", "render_as": "M", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "uploads/20th-century.jpg", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "Arts and Traditions in Everyday Life (1900s-1950s)", "slug": "arts-and-traditions-everyday-life-1900s-1950s", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "###Overview\r\nBy 1900, California\u2019s native population \u2014 estimated at 300,000 at the time of Spanish colonization in the 1700s \u2014 had dropped to just 20,000. Over time, native groups combined, split apart, and recombined in new ways, and individuals were assimilated first into the Spanish culture and later into mainstream American life. After 1900, the number of Native Americans living in California rose steadily as Indians from other states moved to the state.\r\n\r\nAs Native Californian cultures changed, hundreds of languages and countless traditions were lost. Some traditional practices and arts, however, continued. As the 20th century began, these became valuable bits of knowledge for anthropologists to document, preserve, and study.\r\n\r\nMany of the photographs in this topic were taken by anthropologists in the course of their fieldwork. They documented string games like cat\u2019s cradle (part of folk culture in many parts of the world), ceremonial dances, and the names and faces of the people they encountered. They also documented domestic activities such as basket weaving, including the gathering and preparing of fibers, as depicted in several images. One woman is shown cleaning pine nuts in a woven basket; other women use mortars to prepare food. Beginning and end of life were recorded: a woman stands holding a baby in basket, and a group is shown participating in a cremation ceremony in a field.\r\n\r\nWith the closing of the frontier, Americans grew nostalgic for remnants of the disappearing West \u2014 including the \u201cnoble savage.\u201d Anthropologists tended to be less interested in the contemporary lives of the people they were studying than in tradition, so these images portray surviving practices drawn from life before European exploration and colonization.\r\n\r\nOther photographs in this topic, however, show Native Americans dressed for daily life in the new century. The unidentified men, women, and children photographed standing in a field in Alturas; the group of Northern California Yurok, cleaning surf fish in 1928; the families at Tule Lake and Hat Creek; and the two young women whose picture was taken at a fishing camp in 1928 all contrast with the idealized version of California\u2019s Native Americans that appealed to tourists.\r\n\r\n\u201cGetting back to nature\u201d was a popular leisure activity in the early 20th century, and tourists enjoyed visiting rustic camps and the new national parks. There, the sale of handmade Native American mementos, and the showcasing of native traditional arts and ceremonies, helped some native peoples survive hard financial times. Tourists, eager to bring home authentic souvenirs, bought handmade baskets, such as those being sold by the unidentified Tallac woman near Lake Tahoe. For many years tourists in Yosemite National Park enjoyed demonstrations of tradition-based crafts and arts, such as basket-weaving and ceremonial dances (such as the one pictured here presented by Chris Brown, also known as Chief Lemee, behind the Yosemite Museum in 1950).", "render_as": "M", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "uploads/arts-traditions.jpg", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Californio Society, 1830s-1880s", "slug": "californio-society-1830s-1880s", "blockquote": "Californios, elite families that received large land grants from Spain and Mexico, flourished during the 1830s to 1880s.

The hand-drawn dise\u00f1o maps underscore their vital connection to land ownership. The more formal surveyed maps that followed US acquisition of California show changing values regarding land ownership. As Californios lost land and power in the late 19th century, they tried to adapt to these changes by using social networks to maintain their identities as elites. The formal portraits were one way to bolster this image. Photographs of the Ramona Pageant from the 1950s testify to the mythologizing of California's Mexican and Spanish pastoral heritage less than 100 years later.\r\n\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The wealthy Spanish Californian families called <a href=\"/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic3a.html\">Californios</a> were the first group to receive large-scale benefit from California\u2019s rich agricultural resources. Many were given land grants from Spain. After 1821, other families received land title from the newly independent Mexico to encourage settlement in what was known as Alta California.  </p><p>Californio wealth was closely tied to their land holdings and provided credit at local markets. Californios cultivated orchards and crops, but large-scale cattle ranching on large ranchos was key to their wealth. As the paintings show, even small-scale Native American and Mexican rancherias contributed to the management of cattle.</p><p>Nearly all aspects of Californio society were connected to its relationship to the land. This is reflected in dise\u00f1os, hand-drawn maps, which mark the natural geography of the land. Dise\u00f1o del Cayuma includes sketches of trees and waterways and provides a key in the lower left corner explaining details of the land.</p><p>With the <a href=\"/themed_collections/topics1.html\">Gold Rush</a>, and the end of the US-Mexican war in 1848, a massive influx of settlers laid claim to Californio land. Californios were forced to prove their land title in court, incurring large legal fees.</p><p>Under the US legal system, official surveyor maps replaced imprecise dise\u00f1os as legitimate markers of land ownership. The official 1884-85 surveyor map of Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Bernardino counties charts the grids of land with straight lines and careful measurement. Court cases often took over a decade to settle. Many Californio families were forced to sell off their land piece by piece in order to pay mounting legal fees.</p><p>As <a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic2b.html\">transcontinental rail transportation</a> moved westward, railroads pressed the US government for large land grants. Californios\u2019 holdings grew smaller, as the official map of land granted to the railroads by 1875 makes clear.</p><p>Californios depended on labor supplied by Native Americans and Mexicans. In exchange, they would provide shelter and lodging, further intertwining laborers to the land and patriarchal relationships. The photograph of Indian \u201cJohn\u201d and his family at the Santa Rosa Rancheria highlights the identification of this Native American family to the rancho. In contrast, Californios such as Julia, wife of Joaquin Bolado, and Juan Ignacia Cantua are photographed in studio portraits as individuals. </p><p>Towards the end of the 19th century, immigrants from around the world were flooding into California. Many Californios married American and European settlers to secure their land and class status. The stately portrait of Dona Ramona Carillo de Pacheco de Wilson is a good example. Her title, Dona, and her elegant attire denote her elite Californio heritage. Her marriage to a Scottish settler and US military official would continue to secure her status in the early years of American control.</p><p>As the 19th century came to a close, Californios found their political clout vastly reduced and their past already becoming mythologized. Helen Hunt Jackson\u2019s 1884 novel Ramona told the tragic story of a Californio orphan girl who married an Indian. Written to create sympathy for the <a href=\"/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic4d.html\">plight of native Californians</a>, it was instead received as the portrait of an idyllic past. This romanticized vision persisted well into the 20th century.</p><p>The 1950s-era photos of light-skinned actors in the popular Ramona Pageant illustrate contemporary racial biases rather than the cultural reality of early Californio society. During this period, the <a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic5c.html\">Bracero Program</a> was in full force. Increased border regulations and immigration concerns began to separate California\u2019s future from its Mexican past. Commercialized tourism surrounding the Ramona myth, shown here in the photographs of the curio room at Ramona's marriage place (which never existed), reinforced the curiosity of modern Californians about its Spanish pastoral past. \r\nToday, descendants of Californio families still live in the state, and their names\u2014Sepuvelda, Yorba, Pico, Vallejo, Peralta\u2014mark the streets and towns of modern California. Californio society, however, is gone forever.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic0a.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "California Missions, 1780-present", "slug": "california-missions-1780-present", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images of the California missions show the transformation of the mission structures over the past two centuries. Some show the types of people who would have lived in or visited the missions. The missions mark California\u2019s Spanish colonial past, and remain today as sites for community gatherings and heritage.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Establishing religious authority to convert Native Californians to Catholicism was central to Spanish colonization. Spain\u2019s 21 California missions stretched along the El Camino Real route linking San Diego to Sonoma. This mission system was established in the late 18th century, largely under the guidance of Father Junipero Serra. Serra, a politically powerful Franciscan priest, personally founded ine missions, expanding the system into Alta California.</p><p>Father Serra performed thousands of Native American baptisms. His burial site at Mission Carmel continued to be a veneration site long after his death in 1784, as we see in the photographs of soldiers and people surrounding his grave in 1882.</p><p>Early sketches of mission life, such as the image of dancing Native Americans at Mission San Francisco de Assisi (later Mission Dolores) and the scene of the same mission\u2019s outbuildings, show the missions as a living place where different groups interacted to create the mission community.</p><p>Coerced <a href=\"/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic4d.html\">Native American labor</a> was crucial to the construction and survival of each mission. With Mexico\u2019s independence and decision to secularize the missions, Native Americans were released from previous arrangements made with the Spanish religious authority. Without this captive labor, many missions did not survive. Several images show mission buildings crumbling or overgrown with vegetation by the late 19th century. Although several missions decayed beyond repair, many continue to be restored by the communities that have evolved alongside them.

Early California evolved and changed with each new group of settlers. These images depict the developing interconnectedness of California's early cultures. They also underscore the importance of movement and later settlement of peoples in California. Some of the modern images underscore the contested and often romanticized nature of California\u2019s Spanish and Mexican heritage.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>In the late 18th century, the Spanish in California were joined by other European groups. Russian settlements in northern California (shown in the two images of Fort Ross) connected Russia to its other sea otter trade routes, were places to grow food for their Alaskan settlements, and served as bases for trade with Californians. Before the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the French controlled much of what would border both Spanish territory on the West Coast and the newly formed United States to the east. The ink drawing shows a French diplomat being received at Mission Carmel in 1786.</p><p>Early European images of California show these settlers' interest in Native Americans already inhabiting the area. The engraving of Captain Rogers' men being received by Native American men on the shores of California in the early 1800s depicts the two groups shaking hands and the Native Americans guiding the newcomers to shore. The engraving underscores the newness of the interaction, with the Native American men inspecting the explorers\u2019 hair and clothing. The numbers of European and Native American men appear relatively equal in this early engraving; but the ravages of disease from exposure to Europeans would <a href=\"/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic4d.html\">decimate Native American populations</a> by the mid- to late 19th century. The Russian sketch of mules and an Indian boy, and the illustration of the padrone and the Indian boy, show the cultural contact and adaptations underway by the early 19th century.</p><a href=\"/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic4d.html\">decimate Native American populations</a><p>Natural harbors and waterways made San Francisco an early site for the rapid influx of people and settlements. The series of three images of San Francisco illustrates the city's expansive growth in less than 40 years. The 1815 painting shows the view toward the San Francisco Presidio with the Bay and one ship in the far distance. As late as 1837, the print of the view towards the San Francisco Presidio from the ships entering the Bay still show very few settlements in the distance. By the time of the lithograph dated 1851 (one year after California joined the United States, and two years after the <a href=\"subtopic1e.html\">Gold Rush</a>), San Francisco is teeming with buildings, tents, people, and livestock, and the Bay is clogged with arriving ships.</p><a href=\"subtopic1e.html\">Gold Rush</a><p>Military presence was central to the success of each new settlement. It is depicted in both Spanish presidio images and in American fortifications like Sutter's Fort, shown here in a book illustration. Each shows the walls and soldiers meant to provide shelter and protection to the surrounding farms.</p><p>The images in this topic tend to show California\u2019s rapid transition from exploration to settlement from a European viewpoint. The sketches and paintings by early 19th-century Russian artist Ludwig Choris show his interest in Native American arms and utensils, dance performances, and portrait heads. But as the Spanish mission system expands, and immigrants from the Gold Rush crowd California, artists begin to reflect the power of Manifest Destiny. Their emphasis shifts to documenting \"modern\" progress in the construction of buildings, forts, and migration routes like the Overland Route. By 1866 (nearly fifteen years after California's statehood and heavily influenced by the ideas of Manifest Destiny), a certificate from the Society of California Pioneers uses a series of images to mark major historical transitions within California's history leading up to and glorifying United States control.</p><p>Into the 20th century and today, the legacy of California\u2019s early exploration and settlement is apparent in daily life. By exploring the many place markers of Spanish exploration (shown in the 1960s AAA map of California's Spanish heritage), modern Californians may continue to engage with the region\u2019s unique past.

The humorous photograph of a burro in Death Valley is a truer picture of much of the Southern California landscape before water management\u2019s dramatic changes.</p><p>California's population exploded in the 20th century, and more water began to be diverted to serve people and agriculture. A photograph shows the opening of the head gates for the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which fueled the city\u2019s rapid growth.</p><p>In the 1920s, the Hetch Hetchy Valley, near Yosemite, was converted into a reservoir to serve San Francisco\u2019s growing water supply needs.

In 1875, a wedding party poses for a photograph to celebrate a marriage. Cities, too, were laying down social foundations: Anaheim took a photograph of its first city band, and The Deluge Hose Company #2 was San Bernardino's first fire company, equipped with axes, ladders, hooks, buckets, fire bell, and a speaking trumpet.

The sediment washed away by hydraulic mining clogged riverbeds and lakes, threatening agriculture throughout the Central Valley. Conflicts over water arose between mining and farming interests. Hydraulic mining essentially came to an end in 1884 with the Sawyer Decision, legislation passed to resolve this conflict.</p><p>The mining industry also needed a great deal of wood, both to fuel the boilers at the mines and to build extensive canal systems. This demand for lumber helped create the logging industry. California's forests had plenty of trees to log, many quite large. The lithograph \"The Stump and Trunk of the Mammoth Tree of Calaveras\" depicts a society ball at which 32 people danced on the stump of a giant sequoia tree.</p><p>Photographer Carleton E. Watkins was well known for his images of the grand views of the West. He was the first to capture Yosemite on film, and helped shape how people throughout the country and the world viewed California.

The two-part cartoon from the July-December 1882 issue of <span class=\"cite\">The Wasp</span> reflects how some citizens saw the situation. After the Act was passed, anti-Chinese violence increased.

The photograph taken in Placer County, \"Grading the Central Pacific Railroad,\" shows some of the construction.</p><p>Work on the railroad was physically difficult and at times dangerous, and attracting workers was a challenge. The majority of the Central Pacific's laborers were Chinese. A Chinese worker is shown in the image \"Heading (top cut) of East Portal, Tunnel No. 8.\" Both railroad companies actively recruited Chinese laborers because they were regarded as hard workers and were willing to accept a lower wage than white workers, mostly Irish immigrants.</p><p>As construction progressed, the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific competed to see which could lay the most track each day. A photograph of a sign near Promontory Park, Utah, commemorates the day that Central Pacific crews laid an unprecedented 10 miles of track. The meeting of the two sets of tracks \u2014 the \"gold spike\" ceremony \u2014 took place on May 10, 1869. Several photographs and drawings depict this historic moment.</p><p>Now the country was connected as never before: a journey between San Francisco and New York that previously took up to six months now took only days.  The photograph \"High Bridge in Loop,\" from Views from a Trip to California, shows a train passing quickly through a mountain pass. The transcontinental railroad allowed people to travel more, farther, and in pleasant conditions, as reflected in the photograph \"Commissary Car, 'Elkhorn Club.'\" The photograph \"Knights of Pythias at the Santa Fe Railway Station, Anaheim\" shows an example of the popularity of trains.</p><p>Even as the transcontinental railroad brought the new country together, it brought change to the world of Native Americans. The tracks ran through a number of tribal territories, bringing into conflict cultures that held very different views of the land and how it might be used and lived on. The painting <span class=\"cite\">The First Train,</span> by Herbert Schuyler, depicts three Indians pointing past their encampment at a train in the far distance. The railroad also brought an increasing number of European Americans west. One consequence of this influx was the depletion of the buffalo herds, a major food source for Plains Indians. European Americans would often shoot buffalo for sport from the train; by 1880, the buffalo were mostly gone and Plains Indians had been gathered onto reservations. Millions of acres of open grassland were being settled by the people moving west. Eventually, much of this land became the farmland that fed a growing nation.</p><span class=\"cite\">The First Train,</span><p>The transcontinental railroad opened up the West to the rest of the country, even if they never made the trip themselves. A Currier &amp; Ives hand-colored lithograph depicts a train running along the Truckee River in Northern California. The San Francisco publishing firm of Lawrence &amp; Houseworth hired photographers and published photographic tourist catalogs containing views of the West, which they sold commercially. The railroad took hold in popular culture, as shown by sheet music for the song \"New Express Galop [sic].\" There was even a railroad board game illustrating \"Railroads Between New York and San Francisco, California, with Scenes on the Way.\"</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic2b.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 19, "fields": {"title": "Native Americans and Contact", "slug": "native-americans-and-contact", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic reflect the dissolution of tribal structure that occurred over the course of the 19th century. As traditional Native American lands disappeared or were taken away, many aspects of their daily lives changed, including housing, clothing, food sources, livelihood, and religion.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Beginning in the 1700s, the Spaniards built the California Missions to make contact with Native Americans in the hope of converting them to Christianity. One painting by a Russian artist depicts a group of Native Americans dancing in front of Mission Dolores in San Francisco; a later photograph shows a group of nuns with westernized native children in front of the Pala Mission in Southern California.</p><p>As European Americans continued to migrate West throughout the 1800s, they came into conflict with the native peoples who lived there. Native Americans were increasingly pushed off their lands and forced onto reservations. At the same time, whites pressured Native Americans to assimilate. Native American children were sent away to boarding schools with the goal of socializing them and teaching them \u201cwhite ways.\u201d Several photographs depict young Native American children wearing western dress in boarding school settings. Some of the photographs taken in the mid-1800s show Native Americans wearing traditional clothing (including \"Jicarilla Apache Brave and Squaw, lately wedded,\" \"Coyotero Apache Scouts,\" and \"Group of Apaches, in front of the Wick-8-ups [sic]\"). Photographs taken at the turn of the 20th century, such as \"Pummuke\" and \"Chief Chepah, his wife, son, and daughter-in-law,\" indicate that by then even older Native Americans were adopting Western dress.</p><p>Several photographs in this topic are from government-sponsored survey expeditions launched in the early 1870s to chart western lands and native peoples. These expeditions coincided with the beginning of anthropology as a science. In 1879, Congress created the Bureau of Ethnology to study and document the native people and their cultures. Included here are three portraits taken for these ethnographic field studies, and a painting of Sitting Bull, the famous Sioux medicine chief.</p><p>Native Americans clashed violently and repeatedly with the white European Americans moving into their territory. The whites wanted to push the Indians off their land and onto reservations, but the Indians often refused to go. The Lakota branch of the Sioux tribe was one such group, and in 1875 their refusal resulted in the Lakota War. A famous battle in the Lakota War took place at the Little Bighorn River in Montana in 1876; there, US forces under General George Armstrong Custer attacked Crazy Horse and hundreds of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors. In the battle, which came to be known as Custer's Last Stand, Custer's men were outnumbered four to one and every white man was killed. A drawing and a color lithograph show versions of this battle. Some Crow served as scouts for General Custer in the 7th Cavalry. One stereoscopic view shows \"Curley\" \u2014 the only Indian survivor fighting on Custer's side \u2014 wearing a buffalo coat and sitting astride a horse.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic2c.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 20, "fields": {"title": "Preservation of the West", "slug": "preservation-of-the-west", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>Most of these images are the result of government-sponsored expeditions to record the mineral wealth and landscape of the western United States. They show the land in transition, and some of the people and politicians responsible for trying to preserve it.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>During the late 1800s, American industry's demand for more and more natural resources pushed Congress to recognize the need to explore and chart the geological characteristics and mineral wealth of the country. In 1864, William Brewer (seen third from the left in \"Field Party of 1864\"), chief botanist of the California Geological Survey, led the first state-sponsored expedition to survey, map, chart, document, and photograph vast, previously unexplored areas of California. </p><p>The government sponsored several such expeditions to survey and map the territories of the United States. The many photographs taken on these expeditions were used to promote the geographic wonders and scenic beauty of the West to the rest of the country and led to a move to preserve areas of natural beauty and protect them against development.</p><p>In 1871, photographer William H. Jackson traveled to <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yell/\">Yellowstone</a> with an expedition led by Ferdinand V. Hayden, a Civil War veteran and later head of the US Geological Survey (the USGS was officially established in 1879). Jackson took the stereoscopic views of the park included here. The following year, as a result of this expedition, Congress passed the Yellowstone Act of 1872 to protect over 2 million acres in northwest Wyoming, designating the Yellowstone area as the world\u2019s first National Park. \r\nIn California, naturalist and conservationist John Muir (shown seated on a boulder in one photograph) educated and informed the public about the beauty of the state and its need to be preserved. He was instrumental in the move to set aside <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/\">Yosemite</a> as a National Park. Muir was influential in convincing President Teddy Roosevelt of the need to conserve these lands. One photograph of the president's visit to Yosemite shows Muir and Roosevelt standing on a rock at Yosemite's Glacier Point. Another shows Roosevelt with a party of Secret Service men and government officials at Mariposa Grove. \r\n</p><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yell/\">Yellowstone</a><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/\">Yosemite</a><p>Carlton Watkins was among the first to photograph Yosemite. He became well known for his magnificent, large plate images of the park, including the images of Bridal Veil, El Capitan, and Nevada Fall, shown here. His images played a significant role in promoting the West to the rest of the country. An image of sheet music from 1873 called \"Yosemite Waltzes\" reflects how the park was quickly incorporated into popular culture.</p><p>The logging industry, which began during the Gold Rush years, had gained a foothold in California and the Pacific Northwest. One 1872 photograph depicts loggers in Mammoth Forest about to cut down a massive tree (said to be 5,000 years old) that would later be reassembled for the World's Fair in order to show the rest of the world just how big things were in the West. But as logging and other industries grew, and it became clear that the West had a finite amount of natural wealth, the conservation movement gained momentum. In 1892, the Sierra Club began at the University of California, Berkeley, to promote conservation and involve people in the great outdoors by organizing hikes and outings. One photograph shows club members on an outing in Sequoia Forest in 1902. Other photographs picture two women hiking to Glacier Point, and a family camping in Yosemite in 1906.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic2d.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 21, "fields": {"title": "Closing of the Frontier: Everyday Life and People", "slug": "closing-of-the-frontier-everyday-life-and-people", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic show how Californians in the late 19th century worked and played. Many of these photographs reflect the manual labor (mining, logging, agriculture) and services (like barber shops and grocery stores) that supported the rapid growth of cities and towns. As they do today, people spent their free time doing quiet activities like painting, enjoying themselves outdoors, riding bicycles and camping.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Just as they do today, people in the late 19th century worked to earn a living, and enjoyed having fun in their free time. People who could afford luxurious transportation traveled across the country on the <a href=\"subtopic2b.html\">transcontinental railroad</a>, like the people enjoying a meal in the train's dining car..  People of wealth or privilege, such as author Robert Louis Stevenson and his friends, enjoyed yacht bay cruises.</p><a href=\"subtopic2b.html\">transcontinental railroad</a><p>As the railroad linked the east and west coasts, \nmore and more people poured into California. The \"wild \nWest\" disappeared; people of European descent \nincreasingly \ncame into contact with Native Americans and forced them off their lands,killed them, or pressured them to <a href=\"subtopic2c.html\">assimilate</a>; and cities and towns grew quickly. Loggers, like these near Fresno, cut down trees to provide lumber for houses, buildings, and ships. The <a href=\"topics1.html\">Gold Rush</a> was over by the late 1860s, but there was still work to be found in mining, as these images of placer miners in Tuolumne County illustrate. Mercury miners at the New Almaden Quicksilver Mine in Santa Clara (the largest in the United States) are seen riding a crude elevator up from the underground mines.</p><a href=\"subtopic2c.html\">assimilate</a><a href=\"topics1.html\">Gold Rush</a><p>Many others found work, as they do today, in serving people's daily needs. In a photo from 1885, two young barbers offer shaves for a dime in Anaheim. The opening of the People's Meat Market in Yuba City, in 1875, occasioned the image shown here. In a photograph taken around the same time, dressed carcasses hanging in front of T. F. Allen's butcher shop in San Bernardino leave no doubt about what's for sale inside. A blacksmith in Covina is shown forging iron shoes for the horses that were still the primary mode of transportation for most people.</p><p>Small and large farms, like those depicted here, were also a source of income for many people. The introduction of mechanized machinery, like that shown in Pleasant Grove in 1890, made the work go faster. In the background, you can see the workhorse in use at the same time.</p><p>Some farms, like the Bullard Winery in Anaheim, were more specialized. This photograph shows three people bottling wine. Produce from the farms went to markets in towns and cities, but it was also sold by independent sellers. In one image a Chinese immigrant around 1885-90, deprived of the right to earn a living by the <a href=\"subtopic2a.html\">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>, is peddling produce from large baskets he carries on his shoulders.</p><a href=\"subtopic2a.html\">Chinese Exclusion Act</a><p>Entertainments ranged from novel spectator sports \u2013 like the San Diegans watching a hot air balloon in 1888 \u2013 to the athletic. A new national craze swept America: riding bicycles. The two young racers pictured here eventually became Pacific Coast riding champions. Some, like the Schmidt family shown having a painting lesson in their parlor, engaged in quieter activities. School children participated in organized fun, such as this Maypole dance in San Mateo, and the hoop drill at a school in Pasadena.</p><p>With the closing of the frontier apparent, the <a href=\"subtopic2d.html\">preservation of the West</a> became an issue. People began to spend their leisure time not in town, but in the wilderness\u2013now beginning to be organized into parklands\u2013as campers. As campers do today, they fished and hiked and climbed mountains \u2013 although, as is evident in some of these images, they wore somewhat more formal attire. As forests continued to be cleared for other purposes, the remaining big trees, and the stumps that were left, became tourist attractions in their own right.</p><a href=\"subtopic2d.html\">preservation of the West</a>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic2e.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 22, "fields": {"title": "The Changing Workplace", "slug": "the-changing-workplace", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The early 20th century was a time of rapid industrialization and the widespread adoption of mass production. These images show the importance of machinery in the workplace, and how people worked in assembly lines.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The 20th century ushered in a change from handcrafting to machine tooling. Henry Ford introduced one of the first moving assembly lines as a way to turn out more cars more quickly, and the emerging auto industry popularized this mode. A photo of the Doble Steam Motors Corporation factory shows a line of workers and car chassis in production. This new technology, and the spread of industrialization, changed forever the way that work was completed.</p><p>A wide variety of industries all across the country converted to mechanization, and California was no exception. One 1929 image shows young women working in a towel factory in Orange. Photographs taken in San Francisco illustrate that workers used machines to make products as different as Ghirardelli Chocolate and music rolls for automated player pianos. Images also show  women working on an assembly line in a soap factory, and men sewing clothes in a shop (at a time when a good suit, cut on machines instead of by hand, retailed for $40 to $50).</p><p>Automation and mechanization also changed agricultural practices. The combined traction steam harvester built by Stockton J. Barry on his California ranch was one of the machines that changed the way produce was harvested. Mechanized canning changed the way fruit and vegetables were processed and preserved, and made out-of-season produce available year round. Photographs in this group show cannery workers at tables, and cans going through a labeling machine. The introduction of mechanized food processing eventually brought a new awareness of the importance of standards for foods production. The Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act were both passed in 1906</p><p>As workers nationwide adjusted to an increasingly mechanized workplace, good working conditions took on new importance. Workers in several industries formed unions (such as the Berryessa Fruit Growers formed in 1920, shown here) to promote safer working conditions and limit maximum working hours.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic3a.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 23, "fields": {"title": "The Rise of Technology", "slug": "the-rise-of-technology", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the turn of the 20th century, new technological advances such as electricity, flight, and the gasoline engine found expression in new modes of transportation and communication. The images in this topic reflect how these inventions changed daily life in small and large ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Airplanes, electric railways, and automobiles joined railways to fuel Americans' growing sense of mobility. They came to characterize the progressive spirit of the new century. As a result of these new modes of public transportation, people were able to travel faster and more easily within and between cities, changing settlement patterns. One image in this group depicts John J. Montgomery, the first American to fly a heavier-than-air machine, and his glider \u201cSanta Clara\u201d in 1905. An invitation to an air show in San Jose in 1910 suggests the popularity of this potential new mode of transportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several cities had electric streetcars that ran on tracks, and images in this group include streetcars in San Diego, San Jose, and Los Angeles. The hand-tinted image of the Interurban Electric Rail Road running between Saratoga and Los Gatos suggests that in 1908, this was enough of a novelty to rate a postcard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The automobile industry was also growing rapidly. Before the internal combustion engine took the lead in the 1910s, cars ran on a variety of fuels; steam, electricity, and gasoline competed for a number of years. This is clearly evident from the two ads that appeared in the <span class=\"cite\">Saturday Evening Post</span> for the steam car, and several images of people enjoying both electric- and gas-powered cars.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some inventions aimed to make life easier at home. The photograph of a storefront in 1925 shows the existence of appliances such as washing machines, ironing machines, and vacuum cleaners. In their new-found leisure time, people listened to the radio, an invention that was fairly new at this time. Two photographs taken in the mid-1920s show Charles Herrold, the \u201cFather of Radio,\u201d operating radio equipment. The combination of new technologies, more free time, and the ability to get from one place to another relatively easily and quickly allowed people to enjoy new forms of entertainment, as indicated by the photograph of a car in front of a movie theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expositions were a popular venue to showcase the latest in technology, and several images here represent expositions that took place in San Francisco and San Diego in 1915 and 1916.

They also illustrate some of the challenges they faced in assimilating into California society.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>People from around the world continued to come to California in the early 1900s, many in search of work and a better life. Two photographs depict men in turbans in San Francisco in 1910. Southern California attracted numerous Japanese immigrants. Photographs in this group show Japanese workers standing in front of delivery trucks at the Nakamura Company and inside Japanese owned businesses such as the Kusumoto Barbershop in Anaheim.</p><p>Mexicans and Filipinos also came to California during this period. As new farming technologies enabled the consolidation of smaller parcels of land into large farms up and down the state, the need for workers increased. In response, many Filipinos came to work in the fields and in related agricultural jobs. \"Snapshot of Workers' Camp\" shows some of these men.</p><p>Mexican and Japanese immigrants also found agricultural work in California. Photographs in this group show Japanese workers in a field; and another image shows a young Mexican agricultural worker. The photograph of workers in the Tokay grape packing shed in Florin shows a diversity of workers, including an African American woman and Japanese and Filipino men.</p><p>This mix of very different cultures gave rise to tensions and conflicts. Migrant workers were threatened and warned not to take jobs away from other groups. Images include two letters  threatening a farmer with reprisals if he hires Filipinos; and a US Immigration sign in Spanish threatening non-citizens with deportation if they go on strike.</p><p>Although the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 prevented new immigrants from coming to the United States, the Chinese who were already here continued to assimilate into Western culture. A photograph taken in 1910 shows an unidentified San Diego Chinese American family. Anti-Chinese discrimination continued, as evidenced by a letter from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce pointing out the unfair conditions inflicted by the Immigration Law of 1924. Nonetheless, many of these images show that Chinese people persevered, engaging in daily activities \u2014 going to school, working, walking in a funeral procession.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic3c.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 25, "fields": {"title": "Early Advertising", "slug": "early-advertising", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The modern advertising industry really began in the early 1900s. These early advertising images show how companies approached the business of selling products, places, and ideas in the early 20th century.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The promotion of products, particularly national brands, began to become more prevalent in the early 1900s. Some categories of advertising shown in this group of images are still with us today: cars, cigarettes, and products aimed at homemakers. In California, car dealers and garages used advertising to promote products and services early on. One photograph shows the Lush Garage in Orange promoting Goodrich Tires as the \"Best in the Long Run.\" In 1936, a photographic postcard for the Chevrolet Garage in Pomona offered 12 lube jobs for $6 in time payments. And as another image illustrates, one still-recognizable brand, Schlitz Beer, got on the advertising bandwagon early at an automobile race in 1908.</p><p>Photographs of displays from the Westwood Hardware and Furniture Store in 1936 advertise kitchen stoves and camps stoves from Coleman; and Dr. West's toothbrushes, with bristles that \"will not get soggy.\" A 1929 photo shows a baker and two women in costume advertising Piping Pan Cakery Compound in San Diego.</p><p>California was linked with oranges for decades, thanks to early promotion by fruit producers. A hand-tinted postcard from 1908 shows two men in an orange orchard. Colorful ads on fruit crates were a popular form of promotion, and California-grown oranges and lemons presented idealistic images of California in their ads. Some examples shown here include the Sonny brand, with an image of a mother reading to her son; Hewes' Transcontinental Brand, with a train roaring across the country; and the Comet Brand, with a shooting star flying over citrus groves and mountains. \r\nCities got into the act as well, and the tourism industry began to employ advertising. The Southern California city of Orange described itself in its 12-page, orange leaf-illustrated brochure as \"a charming little city of 9,000 souls\" and even had a tag line: \"Orange. You\u2019ll like it.\" In 1936, Gallup, New Mexico, used a postcard to promote its Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial events.</p><p>As the United States entered World War II, it sponsored advertising promoting behavior, ideas, and nationalistic sentiments. The billboard \"Buy Stamps \u2014 Buy Bonds \u2014 Bye Bye Japs!\" which seems shocking today, encouraged people to buy US savings bonds and help fund US war efforts. In fact, according to a caption by photographer Dorothea Lange, she shot this image on April 29, 1942, the day that 600 Japanese Americans were evacuated to internment camps. Another Lange photograph captured an ad for swimming at the Sutro Baths that also tapped into anti-Japanese sentiment with a derogatory stereotypical image and the tagline \"Get in Trim for Fighting Him!\"</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic3d.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 26, "fields": {"title": "Popular Culture", "slug": "popular-culture", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images show some of the ways that people spent their free time during the early part of the 20th century.

At the turn of the century people found entertainment at carnivals and festivals and exhibitions. Photographs here include the California Midwinter International Exposition in San Francisco in 1894, and the Anaheim Carnival of 1911.</p><p>Sports were also a popular pastime. Photographs show people participating in tennis and golf, but spectator sports were also popular. In 1929, Miss Jessie Darnley apparently swam her way to the title of Miss Anaheim in a pool filled with three tons of oranges. A number of players became celebrities, as witnessed by publicity stills of baseball greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Carl Klindt.</p><p>Electricity and improved communications meant that entertainment was no longer confined to live theater. People turned to the radio for both information and entertainment. One photograph shows the family of a Democratic nominee for US Senator, Sheridan Downey, gathered around the radio listening to election results. Another depicts a live radio broadcast.</p><p>During this era the film industry boomed in Hollywood, generating popular images and mythologies surrounding the movies and movie stars. Photographs in this group include some on-set shots of actors, directors, and movie-making equipment. The owner of the famous Chinese Theater in Hollywood, Sid Grauman, is pictured with film star Mary Pickford. Other images include silent film stars, the original \"Our Gang\" cast at the opening of the Broadway Theater, and a shot of the Spreckels Theater on the night of a Three Stooges film premiere in 1934.</p><p>As had been true for centuries, people enjoyed music, literature, and the arts. Images here include jazz musicians performing and a studio portrait of Roland Hayes, considered one of the greatest tenors in the 1920s. Popular literary figures pictured include author Upton Sinclair, whose 1906 book <span class=\"cite\">The Jungle</span> helped raise popular awareness about food processing and contributed in large part to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906.

One photo shows the Castro family wedding party traveling over Anaheim\u2019s unpaved roads in a horse-drawn wagon \u2014 in 1922.</p><p>Gas- and electric-powered machines sped up labor during the first half of the new century, and also powered the new forms of transportation that would soon replace horses. As the work week got shorter, \"motoring\" for the fun of it became a leisure-time activity. Here, a Dublin family poses with their car, perhaps ready for a drive in the country, hats on to protect from sun and wind. </p><p>People still flocked to fairs and circuses, like the one shown in San Diego in 1925, as well as to large commercial expositions like the California Valencia Orange Show. <a href=\"subtopic3d.html\">Advertised</a> in fantastic publicity shots, the show featured elaborate displays made out of thousands of oranges (in 1927, $15,000 worth of oranges was on display), parades, and other entertainment, including the Spanish dancers shown here.</p><a href=\"subtopic3d.html\">Advertised</a><p>Even some prisoners got a break once a year. This photograph from the 17th annual \u201cLittle Olympics\u201d field meet held at San Quentin in 1930 shows a participant in a pie-eating contest. For one day, prison rules were suspended and prisoners participated in athletic events, sack races, and entertainments.</p><p>As the work week shrunk to five days, Saturday and Sunday sporting activities grew in popularity \u2014 not just for players, but for spectators. Baseball, college football, and golf were particularly popular. Both men and women played in local and organizational baseball teams, including the Japanese American \u201cCubs\u201d team and the 1931 champion Santiago Orange Growers Association women\u2019s baseball team from Orange, California. People also watched boxing matches, horse races, and rodeos. Some even flew planes for the fun of it. San Diego aviator Ruth Alexander, shown here, held several official and unofficial altitude records.</p><p>Just a few short years after <a href=\"topics2.html\">the closing of the frontier</a>, \"getting back to nature\" became a fad. Motoring, for many, meant trips to <a href=\"subtopic2d.html\">National Parks</a> and Lodging was hard to find in these remote areas, so camping \u2014 and using cars to haul equipment \u2014 became popular. A 1901 photograph shows a woman standing on top of Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, dressed modestly in a long skirt and big hat \u2014 the same clothes she might wear for a walk in town. In the 1923 photo of hikers on Mt. Tam shows, the men and women were wearing similar trousers and hats.</p><a href=\"topics2.html\">the closing of the frontier</a><a href=\"subtopic2d.html\">National Parks</a><p>Another way to experience the great outdoors was from the relative comfort of the Mt. Tamalpais Railroad \u201cgravity car.\u201d The steam train shown here ferried passengers from the top of Mt. Tam down to the town of Mill Valley from 1896 to 1930. </p><p>Boating and swimming, days at the beach, fishing, and picnicking were also popular ways to spend the day. A 1922 photograph of a family picnic in an oil field near Coalinga shows the oil derricks as just part of the scenery on a sunny afternoon.</p><p>In the late 1930s, the two-day weekend officially began nationwide. Many city streets were now lit with electricity, and people drove or took <a href=\"subtopic3b.html\">electric trolleys</a> to enjoy late nights on the town.

Dating couples out for a night on the town often went to nightclubs. The man and woman pictured dancing at San Francisco's Forbidden City, which featured Chinese American entertainers, were two of the club's singing stars.

They also depict the lives of these families on the road west.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>In 1931, a severe drought hit the Southern and Midwestern plains. As crops died and winds picked up, dust storms began. As the \"Dust Bowl\" photograph shows, crops literally blew away in \"black blizzards\" as years of poor farming practices and over-cultivation combined with the lack of rain. By 1934, 75% of the United States was severely affected by this terrible drought.</p><p>The one-two punch of economic depression and bad weather put many farmers out of business. In the early 1930s, thousands of Dust Bowl refugees \u2014 mainly from Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and New Mexico \u2014 packed up their families and migrated west, hoping to find work. Entire families migrated together (such as the men shown in \"Three generations of Texans now Drought Refugees\") in search of a better life. Images such as\r\n \"Midcontinent \u2014 Family Standing on the Road with Car,\" \"Drought Refugees,\" and \"Untitled, ca. 1935 (Worn-Down Family in Front of Tent)\" offer a glimpse into their experience on the road, and show that cars provided many families both transportation and shelter on the road.</p><p>About 200,000 of the migrants headed for California. The state needed to figure out how to absorb the thousands of destitute people crossing its borders daily. One of their tactics was to document the plight of the refugees. In 1935, photographer Dorothea Lange joined the Rural Rehabilitation Division of the California State Emergency Relief Administration (SERA), a section of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. She was assigned the job of using her camera to document the growing number of homeless Dust Bowl refugees migrating to California. She worked with Paul S. Taylor, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who was researching conditions of rural poverty in order to make recommendations on how to improve the workers' conditions.</p><p>The work by Taylor and Lange played an important role in helping to raise public awareness of the crisis. The reports they made for the government included both data and striking images that revealed the desperate conditions in which the migrants lived and confirmed the need for government intervention. Stark images such as \"Home of Oklahoma Drought Refugees\" resonated with the public, and portraits of drought refugees like \"Ruby from Arkansas\" and others shown in this topic humanized the migrants for more fortunate citizens. In March 1936, Lange took what became one of her most famous images, \"Migrant Mother.\" This image of a 32-year-old woman became an icon for the suffering of ordinary people during Great Depression.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic4a.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 29, "fields": {"title": "Hard Times", "slug": "hard-times", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images show how the Great Depression affected ordinary people.

The so-called Great Depression lasted more than a decade, until approximately 1941. In the United States, the general atmosphere was one of desolation, as expressed in the Dorothea Lange photograph \"Thirteen Million Unemployed Fill the City in the Early Thirties,\" which shows men leaning against a wall in San Francisco.</p><p>Many photographs in this topic were taken by Lange, one of the primary chroniclers of the Great Depression. Lange had been taking portraits of wealthy individuals in her studio, but she felt compelled to go out on the streets and take photographs of everyday people.

The New Deal created a new role for the federal government, one that involved infusing money into the economy largely through the creation of new jobs and social programs. One photograph shows Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act of 1935, which was designed to keep citizens from becoming destitute.</p><p>The New Deal also created the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which funded artists to create public art projects and others to complete a wide variety of work projects, such as the construction of roads, trails, theaters, and public buildings. Several images show the wide variety of work that the WPA helped fund: an artist painting a mural, a man tending a butterfly collection in the Natural History Museum, and people clipping articles.</p><p>Not everyone supported the government's new, expanded role. The image of men holding a banner that reads \"Against Roosevelt's New Deal\" was taken at a Communist demonstration in San Diego in 1933.</p><p>Still others created their own solution to the Depression's hard times by forming cooperative organizations. The aim of the co-op movement was for people to work together and share the proceeds of their labors. In the early years of the Depression in California, many sorts of self-help cooperatives were formed by individuals (often called \"cooperators\").

Photographs show picketers, as well as some of the violence that occurred when strikers clashed with police.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Many people who were employed during the Great Depression grew increasingly dissatisfied with working conditions, and took action by forming labor unions. Although the General Strike of San Francisco took place from July 16 to 19, 1934, it had been brewing for months. In March, Harry Bridges (shown in two photographs) led his International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA, which represented the dockworkers), in a vote to strike for control of hiring halls, better pay, and better hours. The ILA strike officially began on May 9, 1934. A photograph from May 8 shows longshoremen waiting for the strike deadline, and an image from May 10 shows Bridges leading picketers down San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero. Other images show strikers in line for food, and a young man trying to decide whether or not to picket.</p><p>On July 5, when employers tried to open the docks and unload ships, strikers clashed with 1,000 armed police officers. Photographs show police confronting the strikers with what appears to be gunsmoke on one side, and police with tear gas guns. When it was over, 64 were injured and two men were killed on what became known as \"Bloody Thursday.\" The deaths of the men and the huge, public funeral for them (shown in two photographs), helped Bridges rally the support of other unions in the city to join the strike. This General Strike effectively shut down the city of San Francisco for four days. The strike was a success: many of the ILA\u2019s demands were met. A photograph taken in front of the Emporium department store shows a newspaper vendor selling the issue announcing the end of the strike.</p><p>The following year, 1935, the Wagner Act created the National Labor Relations Board that protects the rights of workers to organize into unions.

These images depict the government-funded bridges, dams, and power plants that were built to support the state's growth.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The large development projects of the 1930s, designed to serve a growing population, helped shape California in many ways. Most are still integral today. Photographs show the progress of two massive Northern California projects: the Golden Gate Bridge, which links San Francisco and Marin County, and the Bay Bridge, which connects San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay.</p><p>The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most recognized bridges in the world. It is unique not only because of its vermilion orange color: this steel suspension bridge, with a 4,200-foot-long central span and two towers that are 746 feet tall, is the largest ever built. The photographs in this group, taken between 1933 and 1934, show the various phases of construction from different perspectives, looking down, up, and across the span as it was being built. Some photos also show the workers who helped build this famous structure.</p><p>The Golden Gate Bridge was built under the direction of Joseph Baermann Strauss, an Ohio-born engineer who built more than 400 bridges. The portrait of Strauss also shows the partially built bridge in the background. The Golden Gate Bridge opened to vehicles and pedestrians in 1937.</p><p>The Bay Bridge construction began in 1933, and the span opened to vehicles in 1936. At 8.25 miles, it is the world\u2019s longest steel bridge. The bridge consists of twin suspension bridges. Many of the photos show workers on catwalks with cables and pulleys, building the bridge.</p><p>Growing cities also created greater demands for resources, including electrical power. The building of powerhouses like the Pitt River Power House and the Las Plumas Power House near Oroville, shown here, helped to meet this need.</p><p>Southern California also saw large construction projects. One image in this group shows the San Vicente Dam under construction.</p><p>A few of these images were taken by Jervie Henry Eastman, who established Eastman's Studio in 1921.

Although many people struggled to survive during the Great Depression, these photographs also show that some still found employment, and many managed to enjoy themselves despite the hard economic times. </p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Despite the hard economic times of the Great Depression, California did provide work, much of it hard labor. One photograph shows two men working in an oil rig; another shows men using a steam engine and horses to haul logs. The labor crew of the Great Western Salt Works in San Diego, which produced 10% of California\u2019s salt from seawater in 1932, posed for this picture in the late 1920s.</p><p>The state\u2019s rich farming and agriculture industry also provided jobs. Two men stand with a rig to spray pesticides on orchards. Another photograph shows what happened to a citrus orchard when a rare Southern California freeze iced the trees (and ruined the crop) \u2014 an event so seldom seen that these women posed for a picture. On a factory assembly line, scores of women workers pick over fresh peppers to find the best ones for packing. The Cawston Ostrich Farm  supplied a unique product. The South Pasadena farm provided ostrich feathers for hats, boas (long scarves), capes, and fans. Because the Farm  was near a <a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic3b.html\">trolley</a>  \r\n line, it became a major tourist attraction where visitors could ride on the backs of ostriches and have their pictures taken.</p><a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic3b.html\">trolley</a><p>Portrait photography, a popular commercial industry since the mid-19th century, was still popular during the Depression.

Getting \u201cback to nature,\u201d a pastime encouraged by the development of the <a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic2d.html\">National Park</a>  system, continued to be a favorite activity. One photograph shows a group around a campfire near Bishop in 1930; another shows a family posing in front of Yosemite\u2019s Wawona Tunnel Tree in 1939.  During the summer, Southern California beaches were popular with swimmers and sunbathers.</p><a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic2d.html\">National Park</a><p>People enjoyed public celebrations like the May Festival Parade in Orange. In the 1933 photograph shown here, members of the Nichols family ride a bicycle built for four. Beauty contests were also popular. The Miss Anaheim contest, where contestants \u201cswam\u201d in oranges at the City Park Pool, was part of the long-running California Valencia Orange Show.</p><p>And, as today, children played and parents wanted pictures of them doing it. Don and Bill Burtis are shown in a more formal play portrait, in clean clothes and combed hair, \u201ctaking off\u201d in a toy airplane in Sutter County in 1933.  </p><p>Some even had fun at work. The man pictured here on his Harley Davidson in 1933 used his motorcycle in his job with the Highway Patrol in Coalinga, but he was also known to ride around on his bike with his 200-pound pet puma, Oscar.</p><p>For many, however, everyday life was a struggle. Dorothea Lange\u2019s 1936 photograph shows a migrant family of Mexicans on the road with car trouble. And a Los Angeles Daily News photograph taken the same year shows a mother holding her toddler son in their small apartment kitchen in a Los Angeles \u201cslum.\u201d The least fortunate lived in makeshift towns called \u201cHoovervilles,\u201d after the US president blamed for the state of the economy. The man shown here stands next to an outdoor standpipe, this Sacramento Hooverville\u2019s sole water supply. And thousands who couldn\u2019t afford to buy food received government assistance, like the men standing in this \u201cbreadline\u201d at a kitchen on 4th and Jefferson streets in Oakland in 1934.  </p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic4f.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 34, "fields": {"title": "Women in the Workforce", "slug": "women-in-the-workforce", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images show women at work during World War II, when the shortage of male workers opened new jobs to women.

Those who weren't eligible for service could volunteer to help the war effort at home. As the images in this topic show, people at home contributed to the war effort in a variety of ways.</p><p>Many people readied for possible enemy attack.

Some civilians supported the war effort by buying war bonds directly. Others raised money for war bonds through fundraisers like the Shangri La Queen beauty contest, pictured here.</p><p>Many products were rationed during the war, and the government emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency. Nearly 20 million Americans \u2014 including the fourth-grade children in Colorado and a Japanese-American family relocated to Madison, Wisconsin, shown here \u2014answered the government's request to plant \"victory gardens\" to raise their own food. These gardens, large and small, produced up to 40% of all food that was consumed. One photo even shows children raising rabbits for food in their back yard.</p><p>Not everyone supported the war effort. As you can see in the photograph of a peace protest at UC Berkeley, some citizens wanted no part in the war and held peace strikes and rallies.</p><p>After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, life at home changed for Japanese Americans.

Wartime factory work created new job opportunities, such as building battleships. These photographs, all taken in and around the Richmond Shipyards in Richmond, California, give a sense of what took place at shipyards during World War II.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Industrialist Henry J. Kaiser ran seven shipyards and employed thousands of people. He used an assembly line to build ships, assembling some in less than five days. One image in this collection shows a ship's hull under construction. Another shows a diagram with goals for completing a ship. The workers at the Kaiser shipyards in Richmond, California, produced the most warships in the country during World War II. One photograph shows workers celebrating the launch of one of their ships.</p><p>Kaiser was a forward thinker in terms of employee benefits. As the \"Be a Healthy Shipbuilder\" sign in one of the photographs shows, he was concerned about the welfare of his employees. Kaiser provided his employees with a health care plan by creating the first health maintenance organization, an HMO that exists to this day; and he set up on-site day care centers, where workers could leave their children while they worked their shift.</p><p>Several photographs show the masses of workers who came to work each day, and many show women and minorities working at the Richmond Shipyards. A shortage of male workers and the pressing need for labor (as evidenced by the image of the recruiting billboard), created these new opportunities. This need for workers contributed to the migration to California of African Americans, who came in great numbers from the South in search of job opportunities.</p><p>The many people who streamed into the shipyards in search of work turned Richmond into a boomtown, even attracting national attention. All of the workers needed a place to live, and makeshift living conditions were cramped and uncomfortable. One photograph shows the wife of worker standing in her home: a cramped bus that housed her family of six. Other photographs show families camping in tents and sleeping on the ground as they waited for housing to be built. Some shipyard workers resorted to living on boats, as you can see from the newspaper advertising \"Boats for Sale.\"</p><p>A few of these photographs were taken by photographer Dorothea Lange, who collaborated with photographer Ansel Adams on a wartime photo assignment for <span class=\"cite\">Fortune</span> magazine in 1944 focusing on the town of Richmond, California.</p><span class=\"cite\">Fortune</span><span class=\"h1-5\">California Content Standards</span>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic5d.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 38, "fields": {"title": "Japanese American Internment", "slug": "japanese-american-internment", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the images</h3><p>The images in this group offer a picture of what one Japanese American Internment camp looked like. Paintings, created by internees, depict what it felt like to be interned there.

Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which established 10 internment camps for \"national security\" purposes. Although most internment camps were along the West Coast, others could be found in Wyoming and Colorado, and as far east as Arkansas. One photo shows Japanese American boys in San Francisco shortly before the evacuation order; another shows a woman waiting for the evacuation bus in Hayward; approximately 660 people being evacuated by bus from San Francisco on the first day of the program; and an aerial image of people sitting on their belongings, waiting to be taken to Manzanar.</p><p>The government-sponsored War Relocation Authority (WRA) hired Dorothea Lange and other photographers to take pictures of the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans. Lange\u2019s photographs, some of which were suppressed by the WRA and only released later, often capture the irony inherent in the situation. Although internees were allowed to take only what they could carry with them to the camps, one Lange photo juxtaposes a bus poster \"Such a load off my mind \u2014 Bekins stored my things\" next to a pile of internees' belongings.

The 442nd Regimental Combat Team was made up solely of Japanese Americans, some of whom were recruited directly from internment camps. (Some Japanese American men who would later become leaders, such as Senator Daniel Inouye, were members of the 442nd.)

Parker show suburban homes in California in the two decades following World War II. Many appeared in popular house and design magazines of the era. They offered middle\u2013class consumers a new way of living that emphasized a relaxed, low\u2013maintenance, private, indoor\u2013outdoor experience.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>At the end of World War II, many Americans began to move out of the cities and into the suburbs. In response to chronic housing shortages, the federal government offered generous home loans to war veterans, and tax benefits for home ownership. Aggressive building of highway systems and the parallel rise in automobile ownership contributed to the development of communities well beyond urban centers. These and other incentives effectively jump-started the modern era of the single-family suburban home and the suburban revolution.</p><p>As these images illustrate, California was no exception. Between 1950 and 1970, the nation's suburban population doubled (from 36 million to 74 million residents), with 83 percent of the nation's growth in the suburbs. California's abundant land, cheap labor, and mild climate put it in the vanguard of the new housing movement.</p><p>Home and garden magazines such as <span class=\"cite\">House Beautiful, Sunset,</span> and <span class=\"cite\">House and Garden</span> capitalized on housing trends and provided a blueprint for modern living. Elizabeth Gordon, the powerful and opinionated editor of <span class=\"cite\">House Beautiful</span> from 1941 through 1964, urged readers to study the homes seen in her pages for keys to \"better living.\" \"Above all,\" she wrote, \"try to visualize the social values that such a house represents.\"</p><span class=\"cite\">House Beautiful, Sunset,</span><span class=\"cite\">House and Garden</span><span class=\"cite\">House Beautiful</span><p>The photographs here show spacious, light-filled rooms, housewives cooking and husbands barbecuing, a car in the garage, a back yard with a lawn \u2013 and, in some cases, even a swimming pool. These images demonstrate values such as privacy, efficiency, the embrace of new technologies and materials, an informal style of living, and an easy proximity to the outdoors. The postwar suburban residence was portrayed as a refuge from the cares and stresses of the city. It was to be a self-contained world with all the comforts and amenities one could desire and afford.</p><p>In 1946, developer Fritz Burns and the architecture firm of Wurdeman &amp; Becket designed and built a single-family residence in Los Angeles called \"The First Postwar House.\" This model home served as an experimental showcase to display all the desirable hallmarks of suburban living. A one\u2013story U-shaped building facing away from the street, the home had large windows and doors of glass that opened onto several outdoor patios. Labor-saving devices such as dishwashers and freezers, electronic gadgets such as intercoms, and stereo and radio equipment were found throughout the house. Ample closet space and hidden storage compensated for the home's lack of a basement or attic.</p><p>Other designers and builders embraced similar ideas, such as an open floor plan. Cliff May popularized the one-story ranch house. May and others experimented with moveable walls and built-in furnishings for optimal flexibility. Movement between rooms was fluid, and access to the outdoors easy and expected \u2013 even from a bedroom or a bathroom. The informal plan and indoor\u2013outdoor design also enabled homemakers to keep a watchful eye on children while conducting chores. Durable materials like plywood, polished concrete, glass blocks, linoleum, and plastics kept costs down and maintenance low.</p><p>In the past, garages and cars were tucked behind homes away from the street, while people sat out front greeting neighbors. The new suburban house changed that. Several photographs show carports and driveways positioned in front, screening the home from the street and passers-by. A family's domestic life was now conducted out of sight. One article written in 1950, titled \"Good Living is NOT Public Living,\" claimed \"if your neighbors can observe what you are serving on your terrace, your home is not really your castle.\"</p><p>The backyard became a family's private oasis, hidden by fences and hedges and often boasting play spaces for children, swimming pools and barbeque pits, features formerly associated with public parks and community centers. Concrete was used liberally, freeing the suburban homeowner from tedious gardening chores such as mowing. In suburban developments where real estate was at a premium, these spaces often served as extra rooms, particularly in temperate climates. Many commercial photographs of this era show families happily lounging in these settings, seemingly enjoying life to the fullest.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic5g.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 41, "fields": {"title": "Everyday Life During World War II", "slug": "everyday-life-during-world-war-ii", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic provide a look at the everyday lives of Californians just before, during, and shortly after the years that the United States entered World War II.

They also provide a glimpse into the lives of Japanese Americans, who were forced off their property and housed in internment camps for the duration of the war. </p><h3>Overview</h3><p>When the United States entered World War II in 1942, the nation geared up to support the war effort. Even though the battles were fought far away, the daily  lives of those left on the \u201chome front\u201d  were inevitably affected.</p><p>\u201cLiberty ships\u201d like the Booker T.

The Ford assembly plant in Richmond literally changed gears to build Sherman Tanks, like the one pictured here. The Richmond Shipyards built more ships during the war than any other facility. The photograph of workers here shows a crew made up equally of men and women. With so many men fighting abroad, women\u2014often called \u201cRosie the Riveters\u201d\u2014joined the job market. Another photograph shows a woman conducting chemical tests at Standard Oil\u2019s Richmond Refinery. </p><p>Men and women at home worked to \u201cfight the war on the home front.\u201d Many, like the man holding the sign in San Mateo\u2019s Fourth of July parade, joined Civilian Defense patrols. A special Civil Defense unit called \u201cBlair\u2019s Rangers,\u201d pictured here, was formed in Brisbane to honor a local man killed in the war.</p><p>The threat of war did not prevent young people from enjoying activities such as swimming, like these San Jose high school girls, or doing artwork, like the students shown here. The Kern County Library had a free library bookmobile that visited schools without their own school libraries. For some, providing services to others was still part of daily life. The Bell Family is shown inside the Bell Grocery store on Silver Avenue, and a lively group of men and women\u2014civilians and people in the military\u2014is shown in Dorothea Lange\u2019s photograph of a Richmond bar. At the Santa Ana Army Air Base, soldiers relax at a beer party. </p><p>The war had an impact on some citizens\u2019 housing. Most directly affected were Japanese Americans who, despite being American citizens, were removed from their property and forced to live in government run internment camps <a href=\"/jarda/\">jarda</a> scattered across the United States. U.S. government and news photographs, like the one depicting \u201cjitterbugging evacuees,\u201d tended to depict these families enjoying \u201cnormal\u201d activities, despite their incarceration in guarded camps. Their old homes found new occupants, like the African American family living in the Los Angeles neighborhood dubbed \u201cBronzeville,\u201d which had been called \u201cLittle Tokyo\u201d before the war.</p><a href=\"/jarda/\">jarda</a><p>After the war, photographs show Japanese Americans settling into temporary housing in the Winona trailer camp in Burbank, California.

Photographs of leaders, supporters, and dissenters show that people far from the South were involved in this struggle.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>In 1948, President Harry Truman took an early step towards civil rights reform by issuing Executive Order 9981, which eliminated racial segregation in the military. After World War II, African Americans \u2014 then often called Negroes or \"coloreds,\" began to mobilize against discrimination. They demanded an end to segregation and fought for equality in education, housing, and employment opportunities. The images in this topic show that by the 1960s, their struggle \u2014 which began in the segregated South \u2014 had reached California.</p><p>As a number of photographs in this topic show, many Californians showed their support for Civil Rights activists and victims of racial discrimination in the South by holding marches, rallies, and demonstrations urging equality for African Americans. In one image three white children in San Francisco hold a sign in support of the four young black girls killed in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><p>Photographs also show people in San Francisco boycotting Kress and Woolworth's department stores, sites of racial discrimination in the South. Documents shown here include a flyer urging the boycott of the stores; and a Western Union telegram sent in 1963, stating that Civil Rights activists Roy Wilkins and Medgar Evers were arrested attempting to picket Woolworth's in Jackson, Mississippi.</p><p>Two photographs of memorials for slain civil rights leaders \u2014 a march in honor Medgar Evers in 1963, in Los Angeles, and a memorial in the San Francisco Bay Area for Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968 \u2014 show racially mixed crowds in attendance. But not all Californians sympathized with the Civil Rights movement. Images of racial hatred and prejudice are reflected in the photograph of an African American woman holding a rock that had been thrown through an office window, and Klu Klux Klan graffiti spray-painted on a home.</p><p>Various groups formed to fight in the struggle for equal rights. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), formed in 1909, entered a new phase during this period, leading in the organized struggle for civil rights. An example of how the NAACP communicated about events is reflected in a letter from the Alameda County branch of the NAACP on June 13, 1950, which reported segregation on the Southern Pacific Railroad trains leaving Los Angeles. A flyer promoting the boycott of California grapes exemplifies NAACP support for other rights movements, in this case the United Farm Workers. Other flyers urged Californians to fight sharecropper wages and \"Keep Mississippi Out of California.\" Groups such as the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and student groups also protested segregation and incidents of racial discrimination in the South.</p><p>Several important African American leaders \u2014 including Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, Thurgood Marshall, and Ralph Abernathy \u2014 all came to California, as documented by photographs included here. Sometimes, the price of fighting for social justice was high. Two images capture events held for leaders in the social justice movement who were assassinated: the 1963 memorial march in Los Angeles for civil rights leader Medgar Evers; and a crowd attending a Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial Rally in honor of the slain civil rights leader.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic6a.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 43, "fields": {"title": "The Free Speech Movement", "slug": "the-free-speech-movement", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images show UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement as it happened. Photographs record the standoff and the aftermath.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The Free Speech Movement (FSM) was a college campus phenomenon inspired first by the struggle for civil rights and later fueled by opposition to the Vietnam War. The Free Speech Movement began in 1964, when students at the University of California, Berkeley protested a ban on on-campus political activities. The protest was led by several students, who also demanded their right to free speech and academic freedom. The FSM sparked an unprecedented wave of student activism and involvement.</p><p>Many images in this group make it clear that the center of the activity on the UC Berkeley campus was in Sproul Plaza. One photograph shows students occupying the balconies of Sproul Hall, a campus administration building, holding FSM banners and an American flag. Another photograph shows student leader Mario Savio leading a group of students through Sather Gate toward a meeting of the UC Regents.</p><p>In defiance of the ban on on-campus political activities, graduate student Jack Weinberg set up a table with political information and was arrested. But a group of approximately 3,000 students surrounded the police car in which he was held, preventing it from moving for 36 hours. Photographs show Weinberg in the car, both Mario Savio and Jack Weinberg on top of the surrounded car speaking to the crowd, and the car encircled by protesters and police.</p><p>Other photographs that portray key people and events of the Free Speech Movement include the eight students (including Mario Savio) suspended for operating a table on campus without a permit and raising money for unauthorized purposes; Mario Savio speaking to a crowd; students signing a pledge; and students sleeping on the steps of Sproul Plaza. Photographs of students being arrested, holding a mass sit-in, and picketing in support of the student-faculty strike as they protest demonstrators' arrests reflect other aspects of the Free Speech Movement.</p><p>Singer Joan Baez supported the FSM, and a photograph shows her singing to the demonstrators. Bettina Aptheker, who later became a professor of Feminist Studies at UC Santa Cruz, also supported the FSM. A photograph shows her speaking in front of Sproul Hall. Other photographs in this topic demonstrate that groups such as Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the International Workers of the World (IWW) showed solidarity and supported the FSM.

Photographs taken over several years show the progression: police occupation, burned-out buildings, politicians, and a community looking toward a more hopeful future.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>By the late 1960s, despite the ongoing Civil Rights movement, frustration over poverty, discrimination, injustice, and high unemployment among African Americans helped fuel unrest in many poor, black urban areas. On August 11, 1965, sparked by an angry confrontation between a white police officer and an African American motorcyclist, the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles erupted in a large-scale civil disorder that lasted for six days and became known as the Watts Riots. Thirty-four people were reported killed, 4,000 were arrested, and 600 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Similar riots erupted in many American cities after Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in April 1968.</p><p>Recovery from the riots was slow. Photographs taken two months later show a woman and her baby on the sidewalk, in front of rotting furniture; and a young man standing in front of a burned-out store near his home. Other photographs, taken seven months after the riots, reflect the racial tension that remained between police and residents after the riots \u2014 images of armed officers on patrol and officers frisking black suspects for weapons. And another photograph, taken two years later, shows people walking by a row of still-abandoned apartment buildings.</p><p>The riots got the attention of politicians. California Governor Pat Brown (1959\u22121967) and Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty are shown leaving a post-riot conference in March 1966. The people in the Watts community didn't wait for the politicians; they made great efforts at renewal after the riots. Two photographs portray African American girls and boys walking to their summer jobs in Watts. Another image depicts a man handing out shovels and street cleaning supplies to boys ready to help in a clean-up drive.</p><p>The Watts community also attempted to reinvigorate its neighborhood by holding parades and local celebrations. In one image, the Queen of the Watts Christmas Parade waves to the crowd; in another, Roosevelt Grier, a popular professional football player for the Los Angeles Rams, shakes hands with children at the Watts Summer Festival. And boxer Muhammad Ali leads the Watts Summer Festival in an open convertible. Other important local figures shown here include activist Ron Karenga, (now Dr. Maulana Karenga, the founder of the holiday Kwanzaa); and Italian American artist Simon Rodia, with his famous \u201coutsider\u201d sculpture known as the Watts Towers, which is still a central attraction in Watts today.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic6c.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 45, "fields": {"title": "Struggles for Social Justice", "slug": "struggles-for-social-justice", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images show how a range of groups during the 1960s and 70s chose to voice their frustration with the status quo by staging protests and making their voices heard. Photographs also show the leaders of such groups as the United Farm Workers and the Black Panthers.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The 1960s and early 1970s were characterized by a series of protests as groups that had long felt disempowered sought to make their voices heard. California was the heart of many of these new movements. The protests put into motion by the Civil Rights movement evolved to address social justice issues affecting many groups, including students facing the draft, ordinary people protesting the war, farm workers fighting for better working conditions, Chicanos expressing a new identity, and African Americans who felt that nonviolence as a tactic was no longer working.</p><p>America's continued involvement in the Vietnam War galvanized many groups. Across the United States, students protested US involvement in the war by resisting the draft. All sorts of people joined in by disrupting \"business as usual,\" marching, and going on strike. One photograph shows a banner declaring \"On Strike\" hanging over UC Berkeley's Sather Gate; the deserted campus demonstrates widespread support among both faculty and students. Other photographs depict students marching in protest against the war, signing a \"Women for Peace\" petition, and waving an American flag in an anti-war parade.</p><p>The Chicano Moratorium Committee protested the war by marching in parades, but they also registered their own social justice agenda: one photograph shows them carrying banners that read, \"Our fight is in the barrio, not Vietnam.\"</p><p>People also rallied around workers' rights, pushing boundaries and demanding better working conditions. The United Farm Workers (UFW), co-founded and led by Cesar Chavez, used strikes to protest the unfair treatment that California's mainly Mexican field workers received. In one photograph pickets stand at the edge of a Central California grape field and carry placards that say \"Huelga,\" Spanish for \"strike.\" Another photograph shows UFW co-founder Dolores Huerta addressing a group. Groups demanding their rights did not work in isolation; a 1971 letter from Cesar Chavez to the NAACP reflects the support that existed between the two groups, both of which were fighting for equal treatment under the law.</p><p>The Oakland, California-based Black Nationalist organization, the Black Panther Party, was fighting for social justice on several fronts, in a way that often confused their more moderate supporters. They strongly promoted important and positive social issues such as free clinics, programs to feed children, and drug rehabilitation programs; yet, at the same time, they embraced controversial and at times violent tactics. Although Panthers were involved in violent clashes with police, it is still unclear whether the Panthers initiated these actions or were simply defending themselves against police violence directed at them.</p><p>Many of the Panther leaders were persuasive and charismatic speakers, and photographs here show many of them in action: Black Panther Minister of Defense Huey Newton and his wife, Gwen; Black Panther Chairman Bobby Seale in jail; members of the Black Panthers at a press conference; Kathleen Cleaver in a prosecutor's office; and Angela Davis in Los Angeles speaking to the press after a Black Panther shootout. When Huey Newton was put on trial in 1968, accused of murdering a police officer, Black Panthers lined up on the second day of trial to show their support.

By 1844, he was a major San Francisco (then called Yerba Buena) landowner and later became the city's US Vice Consul.</p><h3>The Gold Rush Era</h3><p>The Gold Rush Era marked the real beginning of African American migration into California. About 200 to 300 slaves came to work the gold fields, followed by free African Americans. As the Daguerreotype of miners at Spanish Flat illustrates, black and white miners worked side by side.</p><p>In 1850, when California joined the United States as a free state, the census showed California with 962 black residents. Many former slaves gained their freedom, but lack of government oversight allowed slavery to flourish in certain regions. In 1852, a fugitive slave law made it illegal for slaves to flee their masters within California's supposedly free borders. All African Americans in California \u2014 born free or formerly enslaved \u2014 lived under a constant threat of arrest.</p><p>Nonetheless, as indicated by the political cartoon \"Difficult Problems Solving Themselves,\" African Americans continued to move West. They came not only from the Deep South, but from Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts. By 1852, they numbered 2,000 \u2014 about 1 percent of California's population.</p><h3>Struggling for Rights</h3><p>During the mid-19th century, even \"free\" African Americans in California were barred from testifying in court or sending their children to public schools. In 1855, Mifflin Wistar Gibbs, an African American abolitionist who had spent years lecturing with Frederick Douglass, helped organize the First State Convention of Colored Citizens of California to fight for suffrage and equal rights.</p><p>Despite their lack of equal rights, African Americans served in the military during and after the Civil War. Included here is an image of an African American in a Union uniform during the early 1860s; an 1899 photograph shows Buffalo Soldiers from the 24th Mounted Infantry in Yosemite.</p><p>African Americans won the right to testify in California in 1863; but the right to vote came only with the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870. The 1867 lithograph \"The Reconstruction Policy of Congress, As Illustrated in California,\" shows the struggle African Americans faced in being taken seriously as voters: they are reduced to a caricature in this political cartoon, along with Chinese Americans and Native Americans.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic1a.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 48, "fields": {"title": "African Americans: The Struggle for Economic Equality (1900-1950s)", "slug": "african-americans-the-struggle-for-economic-equality-1900-1950s", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>African Americans made up less than 2 percent of California's population in the decades before World War I, numbering about 7,800 in 1900. Despite their small numbers, they maintained a sense of community through memberships in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) and organizations such as W. E. B. DuBois's National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Urban League, and the California Association of Colored Women's Clubs. In other parts of the country, African Americans such as Booker T. Washington, head of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, were making inroads into education.</p><h3>The Struggle for Economic Equality (1900-1950s)</h3><p>Most African Americans lived in California's growing urban centers. Racial discrimination often relegated them to low-paying service jobs, such as the men in Anaheim's street corner shoeshine business or the chauffeur standing behind Edith Story and her automobile. But the 1907 photograph of businessmen, which commemorates the 13th annual meeting of Oakland's Afro-American Council, demonstrates the ongoing presence of a black middle class.</p><p>Some black entrepreneurs \u2014 including several women \u2014 managed to find financial success through hard work and good fortune. Former slave Biddy Mason used the money she earned as a nurse to invest in Los Angeles real estate, becoming a wealthy philanthropist and founding the First AME Church. Mary Ellen Pleasant, another former slave, ran several businesses and restaurants in San Francisco and used her resources to fight for African American civil rights.</p><p>African Americans were also part of the popular culture, although their participation was often segregated. A 1923 photograph shows baseball player \"Bullet\" Hilary Meaddows of Oakland's Colored Giants, a team in the Negro Leagues. A 1926 photograph shows African American musicians, the Hartzog Radio Night Hawks, just one of many such jazz bands of the 1920s.</p><p>Despite some notable success stories, most African Americans found it difficult to break out of the \"traditional\" occupations of domestic work and manual labor. This situation began to change as the United States entered World War I, and they found work in war-related industries.</p><h3>War Brings Change (1940s-1950s)</h3><p>At the end of World War I, immigration from outside the United States was largely curtailed, cutting off the flow of new workers to industry and contributing to the \"Great Migration\" of African Americans from the South to industrial centers in the North.</p><p>World War II brought more change. As one photograph shows, African Americans enlisted in the military, and they also moved up the blue collar ladder to careers such as firefighting. In both the armed forces and the fire department, they served in segregated units, as the photograph of Oakland's Engine Company 22 shows. Again, as after World War I, African Americans migrated to California in large numbers. They found work in war industries, including shipping, as illustrated by the photographs of workers at the Richmond Shipyards.</p><p>Many of these migrants came to Los Angeles. Ironically, as illustrated by the 1943 photographed captioned \"Wartime housing in Little Tokyo's Bronzeville,\" a number of newcomers found housing in former Japanese American neighborhoods \u2014 in homes and apartments left vacant when residents were incarcerated in internment camps. Chester Himes's 1945 novel, <span class=\"cite\">If He Hollers Let Him Go</span>, exposed the racial discrimination faced by many black migrants in wartime Los Angeles. Racist real estate policies, including restrictive covenants, limited their ability to move out of segregated urban neighborhoods. Discrimination restricted their access to skilled and professional jobs as well as to higher education. As they returned home from the fight against fascism in Europe, many African American veterans saw the struggle for civil rights at home as an issue that needed to be addressed.</p><span class=\"cite\">If He Hollers Let Him Go</span><span class=\"h1-5\">California Content Standards</span>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic1b.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 49, "fields": {"title": "African Americans: Civil Rights and Social Reform (1950s-1970s)", "slug": "african-americans-civil-rights-and-social-reform-1950s-1970s", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>By the 1950s, African Americans began to mobilize in earnest against discrimination. As the 1957 photograph makes clear, even baseball legend Willie Mays was touched by housing discrimination. They lived in the same culture as white Americans \u2014 as illustrated by the photographs of Oakland's McClymonds High School marching band and the group of young woman at an NAACP-sponsored social event \u2014 and they wanted to enjoy equal rights.</p><h3>The Struggle for Civil Rights (1950s-1960s)</h3><p>Civil rights groups demanded an end to segregation. They fought for equality in education, housing, and employment opportunities, and they made some headway. White-collar and professional sector jobs began to open up for African Americans, as shown by the photograph of commercial artist Berry Weeks working at his draft board in 1960. But not all white Americans welcomed change.</p><p>From the 1950s through the 1970s, movements for civil and social rights, equality, and justice swept the United States. As the photograph of a civil rights rally at San Jose State College (now SJSU) shows, the movement wasn't limited to African Americans but also drew from the white community. As the movement gained ground, however, it created a backlash of racism in many parts of the country, including California. The 1963 photograph documenting a cross burning on the lawn of a black family in San Francisco's Ingleside district in 1963 shows clearly that this backlash was not limited to the Deep South.</p><p>Most civil rights protests of this time were peaceful, as illustrated by two photographs taken in San Francisco in 1963: picketers protesting unfair hiring practices at Mel's Diner, and a march for civil rights on Market Street. Civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ralph Abernathy, pictured here, advocated these nonviolent protests. But others, such as Black Muslim leader Malcolm X, were less patient with the process, foreshadowing the harder-edged protests to come.</p><p>In 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. By February 1965, Malcolm X had also been killed. Later that year, anger and desperation fueled by years of discriminatory practices and police brutality exploded into violence in the Los Angeles African American neighborhood of <a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic6c.html\">Watts</a>. The violence \u2014 triggered by the arrest of a black motorcyclist by white police \u2014 was the most destructive urban uprising in US history at that time. The woman shown standing outside her apartment was just one of many people affected. The riots lasted a week, involved more than 10,000 people, and left at least 34 dead.</p><a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic6c.html\">Watts</a><p>The violence shocked the nation and left the community in disarray. But over the next few years the citizens of Watts pulled together to rebuild their neighborhood. Parades demonstrated their newfound civic pride. One photograph shows former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali (newspapers still called him Cassius Clay) riding in a convertible as Grand Marshall of the Watts Summer Festival in 1967; another shows the Queen of the Watts Christmas Parade in 1968.</p><h3>Social Reform (1960s-1970s)</h3><p>The violence in California and elsewhere in the country seemed to culminate with the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., in April 1968. Memorials were held across the nation, including the one in the San Francisco Bay Area pictured here. A new subject, diversity \u2014 called \"Negro History\" in these early years \u2014 began to be taught in schools, as illustrated by the photograph taken at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles.</p><p>At the same time, the ongoing Vietnam War reached into every community. This 1968 photograph shows San Francisco State College students waiting to hear if their draft number will be called in the draft lottery. After King's death the urgency for a different kind of protest emerged. African American anger was building, and movements for liberation and revolution (such as Black Power and Black Nationalism) gained momentum, usurping the role of traditional civil rights politics that focused on integration.</p><p>The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was founded in Oakland by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in 1966. By 1968, Newton, the party's Minister of Defense, was on trial for murder. One photograph shows Black Panthers protesting outside the courthouse, giving the black power salute. Another shows Panthers Communications Secretary Kathleen Cleaver, wife of author Eldridge Cleaver, talking to the prosecution. Newton fled to Cuba, but returned in 1977 (shown here) and was acquitted.</p><p>Bobby Seale was arrested in 1968 as part of the Chicago Eight protest at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago that year, and again for murder two years later. Like Newton, he too was acquitted. The \"Intercommunal Day of Solidarity\" poster rallied support for a number of so-called political prisoners, including Seale, Newton, and Angela Davis (another Panther arrested for murder and acquitted). Davis, who later became a history of consciousness professor at UC Santa Cruz, is shown speaking to students at UCLA in 1970. Despite the deaths and arrests of leaders, the Black Panther Party was still active in 1969, as the photograph of Southern California Panther leaders at a press conference shows.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic1c.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 50, "fields": {"title": "African Americans: Politics and Community (1970s-present)", "slug": "african-americans-politics-and-community-1970s-present", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>The murder trials finally took their toll. By the early 1970s the Panthers had lost momentum, and so had their call for revolution. A 1971 photograph shows Muhammad Ali speaking to UCLA students about a broader range of topics: boxing, alcohol, narcotics, and his Black Muslim faith, in addition to the Black Panthers.</p><h3>Social Change Takes Hold</h3><p>Meanwhile, the ideals the Panthers had fought for were taking hold in the community. African American politicians like California State Assemblyman Willie Brown (shown surrounded by students) were elected and reelected to public office. In 1978, Mervyn Dymally was the Lieutenant Governor of California. The voices of black artists like poet and author Maya Angelou were being heard. And African American entrepreneurs were operating businesses from day care centers to markets.</p><p>Building on this platform of progress, African Americans in the late 1970s pressed for more social change. A 1977 photograph shows a march for jobs and housing in Los Angeles on Martin Luther King Day, one of a number of similar marches across the country. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the Humphrey Hawkins Bill, aimed at providing \"full employment\" for everyone.</p><p>By the 1980s, Martin Luther King, Jr., had become a historic figure and a hero. Across the nation, the names of streets \u2014 like Santa Barbara Avenue in Los Angeles \u2014 were changed to honor him. The man shown in the photograph, Celes King III, was himself an American hero: the founder of Congress for Racial Equality of California (CORE-CA), longtime president of the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP, and a pilot in the famous all-Negro Tuskegee Airman Squadron during World War II.</p><h3>Rebellion Against Social Conditions</h3><p>At the same time, crime was becoming an issue in the African American community. Photographs show Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke speaking against fraud to a homeowner's association; and another photograph, taken in 1983, shows residents in South Central Los Angeles demonstrating against crime in their neighborhood.</p><p>In 1992, violence erupted in South Central after the acquittal of several white police officers for the beating of black motorist Rodney King. Millions of dollars of damage were done and the lives of many residents were affected. The \"Rodney King uprising\" has also been called the first multiethnic riot because it included Hispanic Americans and Korean Americans as well as African Americans. Many choose to call these events a \"rebellion\" against social and economic conditions in the inner city, rather than a \"riot,\" which only emphasizes the violence. This reoccurrence of urban violence surprised many who believed the Civil Rights movement had improved conditions for California's African Americans. Some have noted that although political gains had been made over the years, continuing economic inequalities contributed to escalating tension. The underlying causes of the Watts uprising \u2014 underemployment, poverty, segregation, and police harassment \u2014 persisted almost 30 years later.</p><h3>Political and Social Change Today</h3><p>Nonetheless, the activism, entrepreneurship, and government programs of the 1970s-90s did foster the emergence of a sizeable black middle class in California. A number of African American politicians won important offices, including Thomas Bradley (five-term mayor of Los Angeles), Willie L. Brown, Jr. (State Assemblyman and two-term mayor of San Francisco), and US representatives Augustus Hawkins, Yvonne Braithewaite Burke, Ronald Dellums, Julian Carey Dixon, Mervyn Dymally, Barbara Lee, Juanita Millender-McDonald, and Maxine Waters.</p><p>Today, upwardly mobile African Americans have moved from the urban centers of Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco into suburbs and the Central Valley and their ability to work together elect local black politicians has actually weakened. As their voting bloc has dispersed, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans have grown in numbers and their political power in the state is rising.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic1d.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 51, "fields": {"title": "African Americans: Community Life, 1950s-1980s", "slug": "african-americans-community-life-1950s-1980s", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p> The images in this topic provide a glimpse into the daily lives and changing lifestyles of African Americans in California between the 1950s and the early 1980s.

A group of children pose in their Halloween costumes, candy bags ready, in 1968. In 1969, two boys play ball in the ruins of Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, home of the old Angels team.</p><p>Although most of the images are of everyday people\u2014in school, at a beauty pageant, doing community service, attending political rallies, taking art classes, going fishing, dancing, and just hanging out with friends\u2014some show well-known African American celebrities in the context of community activities: LA Lakers basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar interacts with fans in 1980. Boxer Muhammad Ali is shown walking with a group of young people in the early 1970s, and riding in a car at San Bernardino\u2019s Black History Parade in 1980. Singer Harry Belafonte is pictured rehearsing for a show at the Greek Theater; in another image, his wife, Marguerite, raises funds for the NAACP. Jazz legend Duke Ellington is shown surrounded by students and teachers at Washington Elementary School in Berkeley during a 1969 visit.</p><p>The community also came out to celebrate the victory of political leaders like Mayor Tom Bradley, shown here with then-Governor Jerry Brown.

In 1964, a group of marchers representing Youth for Service is shown protesting an assault on an Asian store owner in their community.

And according to Eloisa Gomez Borah, \u201cManila men were reported to have been the major population\u201d of one of the earliest gold camps in Mariposa County. Most of the Asian miners and immigrants during the Gold Rush Era, however, were Chinese.</p><h3>Gold Rush Era</h3><p>After 1851, Chinese gold seekers arrived in California in great numbers. Soon, they comprised about a fifth of the entire population in mining areas. The lithograph shows Chinese miners working a claim; and a photograph by Eadweard Muybridge shows a prospector panning for gold in a river in 1852. The title of this photograph is \u201cThe Heathen Chinee.\u201d Twenty years later, Bret Harte wrote the lyrics to a song of the same title (shown here in sheet music), reflecting the mistrust of California\u2019s white population toward the Chinese immigrants.</p><p>Nonetheless, Chinese men continued to come to California. The lithograph \u201cChinese emigration to America\u201d shows a below-decks dinner scene on the San Francisco-bound steamship Alaska. Men are crowded around a wok, eating freshly cooked food. A wicker basket seems to hold rice.</p><p>Many Chinese immigrants earned a living by working claims abandoned by other miners. They also took jobs as cooks, launderers, merchants, and herbalists, hoping to return to China with a small fortune. A song from San Francisco's Chinatown expressed this desire: \u201cI am returning home with purses and bags stuffed full. Soon I will see my parents' brows beaming with joy.\u201d However, low pay, discriminatory hiring practices, and the monthly foreign miners' license tax made this goal all but impossible.</p><p>Some Chinese Californians challenged American racism by organizing unions, as well as through the legal system and in the court of public opinion. Chinese community leaders petitioned Sacramento to overturn unfair laws and worked to gain the right to testify in court (finally granted in 1872). Norman Asing, a restaurant owner in San Francisco's booming Chinatown, wrote to California governor John Bigler in a 1852 issue of the Daily Alta California insisting, \u201cWe are not the degraded race you would make us.\u201d(<a href=\"http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6561/\">\u201cTo His Excellency Gov. Bigler,\"</a> in Daily Alta California (San Francisco: May 5, 1852).</p><a href=\"http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6561/\">\u201cTo His Excellency Gov. Bigler,\"</a><p>One of the many difficulties involved in completing the transcontinental railroad was the problem of finding laborers willing to take on the dangerous, back-breaking work. In 1865, the Central Pacific Railroad turned to Chinese workers, who soon comprised two-thirds of the railroad's labor force. Most of the approximately 10,000 Chinese railroad laborers came directly from China, joining thousands of their countrymen already in California from the Gold Rush era. A photograph shows a Chinese man carrying water for construction; and a lithograph shows \u201cMingling of European with Asiatic Laborers\u201d on the last mile of the Pacific Railroad.</p><h3>Discrimination and Violence</h3><p>By the 1870s, Chinese Californians faced discrimination and outright violence. An economic downturn during this decade heightened job competition and encouraged anti-Chinese xenophobia.</p><p>\u201cThe First Blow at the Chinese Question,\u201d a political cartoon from The Illustrated Wasp, shows a white worker punching a Chinese man. So-called \"anti-coolie clubs\" formed throughout the state (even though the Chinese weren\u2019t \u201ccoolies,\u201d a term referring to those coerced or deceived into migration, or indentured servants) to denounce Chinese immigration. White mobs attacked Chinese communities up and down California, climaxing in an all-out assault on San Francisco's Chinatown in 1877. Another political illustration from The Wasp shows a kitten labeled \u201cChinese cheap labor\u201d growing up to be a tiger that kills everyone in its path.</p><p>California politicians buckled to this mounting pressure and helped pass <a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic2a.html\">The Chinese Exclusion Act</a> in 1882. This federal ban on Chinese immigration was the first such law in US history to explicitly exclude a group of people based on their race.</p><a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic2a.html\">The Chinese Exclusion Act</a><h3>Daily Life</h3><p>Despite this restriction on immigration, Chinese communities continued to thrive. San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown is shown in a variety of images: men on Dupont Street, now Grant Street, are shown in the late 1880s; an 1888 photograph taken near Portsmouth Square in Chinatown shows a cable car going up the street, which is filled with men. Robert F. Blum\u2019s painting of a street corner in Chinatown shows a more festive scene, with women and children.</p><p>Few women immigrated to the United States, as the labor market demanded men for manual labor. Although the majority of Chinese migrants at this time were men, there was also family life. The photograph of \u201cChinese Public School Children\u201d (c. 1890) shows a group of boys in traditional Chinese clothing; the \u201cChildren of High Class\u201d are also dressed traditionally. In the photograph of vegetable peddlers, a woman bends over to choose something from a basket. And a photograph taken in Golden Gate Park in the 1990s shows a family group sitting on a park bench. The group portrait of a Chinese family in Anaheim was taken in 1892. Most of the Chinese in this area worked as laborers or sold produce.</p><h3>Japanese Migration </h3><p>Until 1884, Japanese laborers could not legally migrate. Nonetheless, Japanese settlers first began migrating to California in the late 1860s. By 1870, 33 of the 55 Japanese in the United States lived in California. By 1880, 86 Japanese lived in California.</p><p>In 1884, Japan began allowing people to migrate to Hawaii to work in the sugar plantations. Six years later, many had moved on to California, bringing the state\u2019s Japanese population up to 1, 114 \u2014 about half of the total of Japanese living in the United States. Most of these immigrants\u2014the vast majority of whom were men\u2014probably worked as laborers.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic2a.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 53, "fields": {"title": "Asian Americans: Early 20th Century", "slug": "asian-americans-early-20th-century", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>With immigration from China cut off, those Chinese already in California became increasingly marginalized. They struggled to maintain dignity and financial stability in the face of racist boycotts, discriminatory hiring practices, and threats of mob violence.</p><h3>Chinese American Life</h3><p>In 1906, the great San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire destroyed birth and immigration records, allowing many Chinese to claim American birth and thus citizenship. Because the Chinese Exclusion Act allowed the children of citizens to migrate, many Chinese men migrated as \"paper sons.\" Not actually related, they claimed kinship on paper only.</p><p>As a result of those practices, in 1910, the Angel Island detention facility in San Francisco Bay began to detain and interrogate Chinese immigrants. Over the next 30 years, approximately 175,000 were incarcerated and held, some for up to two years. A photograph shows the examination in the main building of this facility. The detention center was finally abandoned in 1940.</p><p>Throughout the early 20th century, Chinese Americans continued to put down roots in their communities. Photographs from the time show businesses thriving: the shelves of San Francisco's Sam Hop Company are filled and stacked to the ceiling; a merchant has an abacus to do his accounts; and restaurateur Tom Mah \u2014 the inventor of chop suey \u2014 poses In Los Angeles' Chinatown. They also show family life: a man proudly holds a baby (perhaps his grandchild), and children ride bicycles.</p><h3>Japanese American Life</h3><p>California\u2019s Japanese American population also faced prejudice, which culminated in an unofficial US-Japanese agreement in 1907-08 to slow or stop the flow of immigrants from Japan. The exception was wives and children of the men who had already migrated.</p><p>Since most issei (Japanese Americans born in Japan) were single men when they immigrated, it was not uncommon for them to find wives through correspondence and the exchange of photographs. Many issei women came to the United States as \u201cpicture brides.\u201d In 1924, the United States passed a law barring further immigration of Japanese women, evidently to discourage the establishment of families and communities of Japanese Americans. Henry Sugmimoto\u2019s 1965 painting Stop Picture Bride refers to this time. The 1924 emigration papers for one young woman, identified here as Frank Hirahara's mother, suggest she may have been among the last picture brides.</p><p>Despite laws preventing land ownership, the Japanese American population established homes, churches, and businesses. Mr. and Mrs. Tagawa, their daughter and a man are shown at work in the Hanford laundry business they started in 1910. A portrait of Kumakichi Takeoka is inset over the photograph of his farm in Florin.</p><p>In addition to labor jobs with the railroads, in the fields, and in domestic jobs, they established their own enterprises in fishing and agriculture, particularly in Central California. A plaque commemorates the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony, the first agricultural settlement of pioneer Japanese immigrants. One photograph shows Japanese American farm women wearing bonnets and long dresses in 1915; another shows Japanese workers among a very diverse group of farmworkers. A playful photo shows a man identified as Mr. Kawada riding a bicycle in a field in Elk Grove.</p><p>By 1910, there were 41,356 Japanese residents and Japanese Americans in California (<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/5views/5views4b.htm\">\"Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California\"</a> published by the National Parks Service). A home in Coronado, in an 1895 photograph, shows a distinct Japanese influence. Photographs \u2014 like those of Mary Hirahara\u2019s mother, the Taketa family, Walter Tsukamoto and his family, and Florin\u2019s baseball team \u2014 show Japanese Americans firmly entrenched in American middle-class society.</p><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/5views/5views4b.htm\">\"Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California\"</a><p>Initially, most of the population had been in San Francisco and Northern California because San Francisco was the major point of entry to the United States. However, several factors \u2014 including the 1906 earthquake and fire, laws preventing land ownership, and the fall of agricultural prices after WWI\u2014caused many Japanese Americans to migrate to cities, particularly Los Angeles, which is still home to a vibrant Little Tokyo.</p><h3>Immigration from India</h3><p>In the early part of the 20th century, small numbers of Punjabi migrants from India came to Central California as farmers. One photograph shows \u201cHindu\u201d laborers in a field on San Joaquin Island; another shows their housing conditions.</p><p>After 1917, pressured by labor interest groups, Congress barred immigration from India. Due to a gender imbalance in the Indian community, a good number of the Punjabi farmers in California\u2019s Imperial Valley married local Mexican women. A photograph from 1910 shows a turbaned man identified as Indian or South Asian sitting with another man on a wooden sidewalk in San Francisco. In 1921, San Francisco\u2019s \"Hindoo\" (Hindu) Temple was the only one in the United States. The photograph of Mary Singh Rai and her mother, Ernestine Singh, was taken in the 1930s.</p><h3>Korean Immigration</h3><p>Beginning at the turn of the 20th century, a handful of Korean laborers, students, and expatriate intellectuals migrated to California. For over 20 years, a Presbyterian mission in Los Angeles\u2019 Bunker Hill neighborhood was a focal point for the community. Because Japan began a colonial occupation of Korea in 1910 and afterward, exclusionary immigration and land ownership laws that targeted Japanese also affected the lives of Koreans in the United States.</p><h3>Filipino Immigration</h3><p>At first, Filipinos freely migrated to the United States because the American conquest of the Philippines in 1902 granted them \u201cUS national\u201d status. The 1920s saw a huge influx of Filipinos into California, mainly in response to the need for agricultural workers following the exclusion of Chinese and Japanese. Photographs show some of these men at work, and in their workers\u2019 camps.</p><p>By 1930, more than half of the Filipinos in the United States lived in California. Many of them were brought in as strike-breakers, which led to racial tensions, especially with Mexican and whites, who perceived them as taking away work. Threatening letters like the one shown here warned of violence to come.</p><p>In 1929, tensions erupted into violence in Exeter, California, when a mob attacked a Filipino camp. More riots and violence followed in San Jose, San Francisco, and Watsonville, where conflict arose not only from labor competition, but also because local European Americans were opposed to Filipinos dating white women.</p><p>The vast majority of Filipinos were male seasonal or migratory laborers. Well-dressed men (but no women) pose in front of the Manila Pool Hall; and the group photograph of the Lapog Sons of San Jose shows only a few women among all the men. The lack of Filipino women, and the families that would result, meant there was never a \u201cLittle Manila\u201d or \u201cFilipinotown\u201d as strong as the Chinatowns or Little Tokyos in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Nevertheless, Filipino migrants often founded fraternal and other community organizations like the Lapog Sons to provide spaces for social interaction, sometimes a rotating loan system, and a network for news about available jobs).</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic2b.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 54, "fields": {"title": "Asian Americans: World War II", "slug": "asian-americans-world-war-ii", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>By 1940, people from many different ethnic and racial groups made their home in California. A set of maps show the distribution of racial and national groups in the greater Los Angeles area, based on the 1940 US census. Asian groups listed include Japanese, Filipino, and \u201cforeign born from Asia.\u201d A news photo taken shortly before Pearl Harbor shows a diverse group of chefs at a Los Angeles restaurant \u2014 a Filipino, a Japanese American, and a Chinese American. According to the caption, \"And they get along too.\"</p><h3>During the War</h3><p>As the century progressed, Japanese Americans became established in industries related to growing and selling produce and flowers. By the time of the US entry into World War II, these industries were thriving, and many Japanese Americans had entered the middle class.</p><p>After the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, however, the federal government rounded up and relocated 120,000 Californians of Japanese descent in the name of national security. Dorothea Lange took the photograph of farm families boarding an evacuation bus in Centerville, carrying parcels (evacuees were only allowed to take what possessions they could carry). Two-thirds of the Japanese Americans were actually American born, and thus citizens. Most were incarcerated in 10 remote and guarded \u201crelocation camps\u201d for more than two years, despite never being convicted \u2014 or even formally accused \u2014 of a crime. Conditions were bleak in the camps: a photograph shows a man resting on a cot after moving his possessions into a cramped room; and a painting by internee artist Estelle Ishigo portrays a family at home in the camps. To prove their loyalty and patriotism, many men joined the segregated all-Japanese American <a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic5f.html\">442nd Regimental Combat Team</a>, the most decorated military unit in American history. <a href=\"/jarda/\">See more images of Japanese American internment.</a></p><a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic5f.html\">442nd Regimental Combat Team</a><a href=\"/jarda/\">See more images of Japanese American internment.</a><p>Chinese Americans were well aware of the virulent racism made worse by war with Japan. As the photograph illustrates, some wore buttons that read \u201cI am Chinese\u201d to distinguish themselves from Japanese. Given China\u2019s ally status, Chinese Americans suffered less discrimination than Japanese. Many Chinese joined the military. A photograph of Chinatown\u2019s American Legion post shows veterans of World Wars I and II. Like other American women during the war-based labor shortage, Chinese American women worked on the home front \u2014 illustrated here by a woman on a construction site.</p><p>In 1943, Congress passed the Magnuson Act, which repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The reasons were twofold: the United States sought out China as an ally during WWII, and also sought to deflect Japanese propaganda in Asia that called the United States a racist country for its exclusionary and segregationist practices. Due to provisions of the Magnuson Act and a later War Brides Act, Chinese Americans were able to bring wives to America, beginning a new generation.</p><p>Approximately 250,000 Filipino men joined the US armed forces to fight in World War II. Anacieto Soriano, Sr. (at right) and his friend are shown wearing their 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment uniforms. But after the war, President Truman signed the Recission Act of 1946, effectively erasing their service records and denying them military benefits. Many of these California veterans live in near poverty today. As of mid-2007, S. 57, The Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007, has not been voted on.</p><h3>Postwar Life</h3><p>Upon release at the end of the war, many Japanese Americans found themselves destitute, stripped of their homes, possessions, and businesses, forced to begin again to build lives in the United States.</p><p>Recognizing the injustice of the relocation campaigns, the US Congress made partial reparations to Japanese Americans in 1948. Years later, after intense lobbying by community activists, Congress passed the 1988 Civil Liberties Act. It mandated a formal apology, $20,000 compensation for former internees, and the creation of a fund to educate the public about the camps and the unconstitutional nature of the internment. But the stigma of being labeled national enemies simply because of their race lingered among many second-generation Japanese Americans.</p><p>Although life may have improved for some Filipinos following their service during WWII, many remained in a world of migrant labor. However, many Filipinos unionized following the war and became active in the <a href=\"subtopic3f.html#ufw\">United Farm Workers.</a> Philip Vera Cruz, for example, was a part of the UFW leadership along with Mexican Americans C\u00e9s\u00e1r Chavez and Dolores Huerta.</p><a href=\"subtopic3f.html#ufw\">United Farm Workers.</a><span class=\"h1-5\">California Content Standards</span>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic2c.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 55, "fields": {"title": "Asian Americans: New Communities: 1960s-Present", "slug": "asian-americans-new-communities-1960s-present", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>The 1965 Immigration Act ended various exclusionary immigration policies. It also set up a system of preference that favored skilled workers and the families of American citizens. This landmark piece of legislation facilitated massive new waves of Asian migration. New communities arose, such as Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown, and the Sikh community in Yuba City, whose temple is pictured here. As Asian migrants with more capital arrived, \u201csuburban Chinatowns\u201d such as Monterey Park grew.</p><h3>The End of the Vietnam War</h3><p>The end of the Vietnam War in 1973 brought waves of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Over 1.2 million people from Southeast Asia migrated to the United States, most arriving between 1975 and the late 1990s.</p><p>At first, most newcomers were those on the losing side, fleeing from the Communist regime; later refugees fled continuing political, religious, ethnic persecution. In the late 1970s, the United States accepted refugees known as \u201cboat people,\u201d mostly ethnic Chinese and Vietnamese desperately trying to flee Vietnam on the South China Sea.</p><p>An SOS collage speaks to the harsh conditions in Vietnamese refugee camps, as do the paintings The Strength of Youth and Dai Giang Nguyen\u2019s Life in the Camps. The rights of the boat people were still an issue in the 1990s, as demonstrated by the 1992 Walk for Boat Peoples\u2019 Rights.</p><p>The US government dispersed the refugees throughout the United States in small groups, hoping to mediate any hostility toward them from Americans who were worried about losing jobs to the newcomers, who were also a reminder of the contentious war years. The first major settlement was in Orange County, just north of Camp Pendleton, the port of entry for many refugees. Southeast Asians from around the country slowly migrated to Westminster and surrounding areas, which soon became known as Little Saigon.</p><h3>Assimilation and Tradition</h3><p>Over the ensuing decades, people from many cultures of Southeast Asia came to live in California, and began to assimilate into American culture. A Cambodian family posed for an anti-smoking poster; and a Lao farmer holds tomatoes in a field in Livermore.</p><p>They also kept their traditions alive. Many Southeast Asian groups are represented in these photographs:  A casual Hmong family party is held in a living room; and a more traditional Hmong new year\u2019s celebration is held elsewhere. Photographs also picture Liu Mien Yao people in traditional dress, including a baby wearing a Yao cap; three Lao girls in Lao dresses; and a family at Baci ceremony, a Lao tradition held to honor a variety of life events. Two young men participate in a Mien ceremony in Richmond, on the anniversary of a death; and Cambodian girls dance at a new year\u2019s festival in San Francisco. A monk is pictured in a Lao Buddhist temple in Oakland; and a Mien altar hangs on a wall in Sacramento; and picketers protest political unrest in Laos.</p><p>The Korean American community was also struggling with issues of assimilation and ethnic identity in the 1970s. In 1977, investigative reporter K. W. Lee wrote a series of articles about the wrongful conviction of Chol Soo Lee, a young Korean immigrant, for murder. These articles sparked the first successful pan-Asian political movement in the United States and ultimately led to Chol Soo Lee\u2019s release and full acquittal. In 1979, K. W. Lee founded the first English-language Korean American newspaper, <span class=\"cite\">Koreatown,</span> which lasted until 1982.</p><span class=\"cite\">Koreatown,</span><p>In 1992, Asian Americans \u2014 Korean Americans in particular \u2014 came into the national spotlight during the Los Angeles uprisings. Following the acquittal of four officers who savagely beat black motorist Rodney King, Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown, Pico Union, and South Central went up in flames as rioters looted stores. The news media tended to focus on the conflict between Korean shopkeepers and their black patrons, neglecting to highlight the legacies of economic deprivation and police brutality against blacks in the inner city.</p><h3>Asian Californians Today</h3><p>Today, California is home to 40 percent of all Asian Americans. The 2000 census showed that the majority of Cambodian (84, 559), Laotian (65,058), Hmong (71,741), and Vietnamese (484,023) refugees to the United States settled in California. Politicians such as Tony Lam and Tan Nguyen make sure Southeast Asian American voices are being heard. Quietly Torn, a literary journal by young Lu Mien women living in Richmond California in 1999, demonstrates that these recent refugees are engaged with American culture.</p><p>Although Southeast Asians have been in California for a relatively short time, they have become well established. Entrepreneurs own businesses, such as the market and bakery pictured here, and many have entered the middle class.</p><p>Asian American groups whose history in the United States goes back many more years are also thriving. Currently, there are 980,642 Chinese Americans, 918,678 Filipino Americans, 345,881 Korean Americans, 314,819 Asian Indian Americans, and 288,854 Japanese Americans living in California.</p><p>Indeed Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing minority groups in California. Asian Americans are also one of the most diverse racial groups, comprising many different ethnicities, varying income and educational rates, and political ideologies. In recent years, Asian Americans have been a part of debates on bilingual education, affirmative action, gaining rights for Filipino American WWII veterans (who were denied various benefits after the war), and labor and immigrant rights.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic2d.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 56, "fields": {"title": "Everyday Life and Cultural Traditions,1860s-1980s", "slug": "everyday-life-and-cultural-traditions1860s-1980s", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this group offer a glimpse into the daily lives of Asian Americans in California from the 1860s to the 1980s.

In the 19th century, some immigrants still wore traditional dress (like some of the men in Hanford\u2019s Sun Chung Kee Store, the bamboo flute player posing on the street in Yuba County, and the men and boys in the family on the street in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown). As these images show, they own businesses, work for other people, attend school, and commemorate family events and important life passages.</p><p>As Asian immigrants have assimilated into the larger American culture, their photographs \u2014 such as the Murakami and Hirahara family portraits, the man standing in front of his car in the 1940s, and the Chan Brothers truck stuck in a flood in 1955 \u2014 reflect this \u201cAmericanization.\u201d</p><p>In the process, however, Asian Californians have also managed to keep a rich variety of cultural traditions alive, in public and private celebrations. For example, some later images document weddings and birthdays and holiday celebrations. These images also make clear the continuation of traditional religious celebrations (such as the Thai monks celebrating at the Wat Thai temple in North Hollywood, and the people eating at the Lao Baci ceremony), and the persistence of traditional community celebrations (evidenced by the many photos of dragon parades over the course of more than 100 years). Asian participation in contemporary arts is seen in the image of the Asian American Theatre Company\u2019s performance of David Henry Hwang\u2019s \u201cF.O.B.\"</p><p></p><span class=\"h1-5\">California Content Standards</span>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic2E.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 57, "fields": {"title": "Hispanic Americans: Migrant Workers and Braceros (1930s-1964)", "slug": "hispanic-americans-migrant-workers-and-braceros-1930s-1964", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>During the 20th century, Hispanic Americans \u2014 the majority of whom were Mexican Americans \u2014 comprised the largest minority group in California. One-half million Mexicans migrated to the United States during the 1920s, with more than 30 percent settling in California.</p><h3>Migrant Workers</h3><p>The photographs in this section (many taken by Dorothea Lange) show Mexican migrant workers in California agriculture. Families (like the one whose car has broken down on the road) faced rough living conditions in the fields. The photograph of field shacks constructed of tin cans is a good example.</p><p>During the Great Depression of the 1930s, racial anxieties ran high. Mexicans in California and other states were seen as competition for already scarce jobs. Various civic organizations and chambers of commerce successfully pressed local, county, and state governments to round up Mexican Americans indiscriminately (citizens and non-citizens alike) and \"repatriate\" them to Mexico.</p><h3>The Bracero Program</h3><p>This situation shifted in the early 1940s. World War II brought a labor shortage as American workers joined the armed forces. In 1942, Congress enacted the Emergency Labor Program \u2014 called the <a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic5c.html\">Bracero Program</a> (<span class=\"cite\">brazos</span> is the Spanish word for arms) \u2014 to allow temporary Mexican migrants into the United States to work in American industry.

This migration had an enormous and lasting impact on the state's economy and demographics.</p><h3>Other Types of Work</h3><p>Not all Mexican migrants worked in the fields. As these photographs show, they found work in canneries and fruit packing, among other industries. Some were entrepreneurs, like the Veyna family of Anaheim, who opened a fruit stand (shown here), a restaurant, and a grocery store. Frank Gonzales, also shown here, was a barber.</p><h3>Illegal Immigration</h3><p>As it is today, illegal immigration was also an issue in the mid-20th century. A photograph taken in the 1940s shows a picketer in downtown Los Angeles, protests illegal raids by the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization.</p><p>A 1954 photograph shows a Bracero entering the country legally from Mexicali. Another 1954 photograph documents Mexican laborers returning home after they have completed their US work contracts.

A photograph from around the same time (perhaps an ad for a car dealer) shows two women sitting on a car and being serenaded by a Mexican singer with a guitar. By the 1940s, the Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo was being celebrated in Mexican American communities, as shown in the photograph of one such celebration in Los Angeles.</p><p>In a photograph from 1948, actress Anita Aros (center) poses with other costumed actors as they prepare for a fiesta on Olvera Street, a tourist-oriented street in downtown Los Angeles that was also the site for the photograph of the \"blessing of the animals.\" Olvera Street romanticized Mexican American life, but was also the site of historic buildings, such as the Avila Adobe.</p><p>\"Traditional\" outfits like those worn by Mexican cowboys from the Fiesta des Rosas in Santa Clara, and the souvenirs sold on Olvera Street, eventually became clich\u00e9.

Oxnard's Dolores Tejeda won the title \"La Reina del Churubusco IX,\" Queen of Beauty of the Southland's Latin-American colony, in 1948. The same year, carrying on strong religious traditions in the Mexican American community, a little girl named Rose Veyna celebrated her first communion, in Anaheim.

Actor Leo Carillo, who became famous playing the stereotypical Pancho, sidekick to Duncan Reynaldo's Cisco Kid, was descended from an old Californio family. He later became a respected preservationist and conservationist, and Leo Carillo State Park near Malibu was named for him.

The remaining residents were forcibly removed from their homes and properties in a controversial eminent domain decision.

Even as Californians romanticized their state's 19th-century Mexican heritage, most turned a blind eye to the problems faced by Mexican Californians in the present.</p><a name=\"ufw\"></a><h3>United Farm Workers (UFW)</h3><p>In 1966, community organizers C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and Dolores Huerta helped found the United Farm Workers (UFW), a labor union aimed at organizing migrant farm workers \u2014 mostly Mexican, but many Filipinos \u2014 who had endured decades of perilous working conditions, low pay, and no job security. (The painting <span class=\"cite\">Campesino</span>, by Daniel Desiga, powerfully illustrates a farmworker thinning plants with <span class=\"cite\">el cortito</span>, a short hoe. This backbreaking work was later outlawed by the UFW.)</p><span class=\"cite\">Campesino</span><span class=\"cite\">el cortito</span><p>The UFW flag was designed by Ricardo Favela and printed by Louie \"The Foot\" Gonzalez. It features a Mayan-inspired American eagle and the slogan <span class=\"cite\">Huelga</span>, Spanish for strike. The UFW's most famous action was the Delano Grape Strike \u2014 a boycott of grape growers in the Delano area that lasted five years, and was later extended to include lettuce, Gallo wine (as shown in the photograph of a march against the winemaker), and the Safeway grocery chain (UFW complaints are outlined in a poster by Victor Ochoa). Eventually, the grassroots organization of impoverished farmworker families received support from the United Auto Workers, AFL-CIO, Attorney US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and California Governor Jerry Brown. By 1975, a Louis Harris poll found that 17 million Americans were boycotting grapes. The UFW went on to enjoy other successes, and is still rerpresenting farmworkers today.</p><span class=\"cite\">Huelga</span><p>C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez died in 1993. In 1994, President Bill Clinton posthumously awarded him the Medal of Freedom, American's highest civilian honor. Dolores Huerta, still politically active, was a driving force in the Chicano Civil Rights movement.</p><p>Although the UFW made huge gains, migrant farmworkers still worked under harsh conditions. The series of photographs taken in the 1980s shows workers gathering at a hiring hall, melon pickers being transported through fields in a truck bed, and a lettuce harvester in the hot sun. As illustrated by the photograph of the family harvesting walnuts in Gilroy, children accompanying their parents in the fields.</p><h3>La Raza</h3><p>The labor activism of Ch\u00e1vez and Huerta comprised one arm of the La Raza movement (<span class=\"cite\">la raza</span> is Spanish for the race, or the people). It endeavored to expose and overturn the discrimination in employment, housing, and education that Hispanic Americans faced in California.</p><span class=\"cite\">la raza</span><p>The La Raza movement included muralists, poets, entrepreneurs, politicians, and labor organizers within its ranks, and descendants of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other parts of Latin America in addition to Mexico. One poster that came out of this movement proclaims \"Independence for Puerto Rico.\" The poster of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara has the words <span class=\"cite\">\"Hasta la victoria siempre\"</span> (\"Keep fighting until victory\"), a phrase used by Guevara in the last letter he wrote to Fidel Castro, and a goal of La Raza. Guevara became a cultural icon and symbol for non-Cuban Hispanic Americans (his face is also seen on the picket sign carried in the Chicano Moratorium march, below).</p><span class=\"cite\">\"Hasta la victoria siempre\"</span><h3>The Chicano Movement</h3><p>Chicano activists of the 1960s were concerned with reclaiming their pre-Columbian, Native American, and Mexican cultural identities. The Chicano Civil Rights Movement led to an increased understanding of Chicano identity in a historical, binational, and bicultural context. The Chicano Moratorium staged a walkout of high school students in 1968, and a demonstration in East Los Angeles in 1970 that drew 30,000 marchers. One photograph shows protestors holding signs that read, \u201cOur fight is in the barrio, not Vietnam.\u201d</p><p>The Chicano art movement began in the 1960s in support of the UFW labor struggle, and for Luis Valdez's Teatro Campesino (Farmworkers' Theater). Rudy Cuellar's poster is a lively example (the letters RCAF on the shirt pocket stand for \"Royal Chicano Air Force\"). Many of the other prints in this topic were produced by Self Help Graphics, an East Los Angeles gallery and community art center dedicated to exploring the culture and community of the Chicano movement in California. Later Chicano artworks (such as Ester Hernandez's biting 1982 <span class=\"cite\">Sun Mad Raisins</span>) were often directly inspired by the political and cultural developments among \"working class\" (low-wage earning) Mexican Americans in California.</p><span class=\"cite\">Sun Mad Raisins</span><p>Wall murals, like the <span class=\"cite\">Sherman Youth</span> mural in San Diego, became a popular artform. The muralists often used volunteers from the community, such the Woodrow Wilson Junior High School students shown in the photograph. The mural tradition has remained strong, as evidenced by <span class=\"cite\">La Revolucion Continua</span> (1996), and by <span class=\"cite\">Raza Unida</span> (200-2002), painted on a concrete freeway underpass in Chicano Park, San Diego.</p><span class=\"cite\">Sherman Youth</span><span class=\"cite\">La Revolucion Continua</span><span class=\"cite\">Raza Unida</span><h3>Hispanic Californians Today</h3><p>The 2000 census produced an informative snapshot of California today. The state is more multicultural than ever before, and 32 percent of the population is Hispanic American. These numbers have created both a rise in Hispanic American political power, and a growing awareness of issues that affect the Hispanic American community.</p><p>Recently, the historic struggle over illegal immigration and border control between the United States and Mexico has grown more contentious, and border crossings have grown more dangerous. The portion of the Border Crossing Memorial shown here asks, <span class=\"cite\">\"\u00bfCuantos mas?\"</span> How many more? Between the two words is a series of wooden panels painted with red numbers, resembling a counter. The last panel has two numbers, as if in transition.</p><span class=\"cite\">\"\u00bfCuantos mas?\"</span><p>Ongoing controversies over illegal immigration and bilingual education have mobilized California's Hispanic population, even as they exposed internal class and cultural divisions. Despite a tradition of activism, Hispanic Californians had trouble winning public office throughout the 20th century. But the recent elections of Cruz Bustamante (Lieutenant Governor), Antonio Villaraigosa (Los Angeles mayor), Rocky Delgadillo (Los Angeles City Attorney), and Fabian Nu\u00f1ez (Assembly Speaker) suggest the arrival of a powerful 21st-century political presence</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic3f.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 62, "fields": {"title": "Everyday Life: Hispanic Americans", "slug": "everyday-life-hispanic-americans", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic provide a glimpse into the daily lives and changing lifestyles of California's Hispanic Americans during the 1940s, 50s, 60s,and 70s, as the nation moved from the <a href=\"/themed_collections/topics5.html\">World War II years</a> to the era of <a href=\"/themed_collections/topics6.html\">social reform</a>.

By 1823, Spaniards had founded 21 missions and numerous villages from San Diego to Sonoma.</p><h3>Spanish Colonization and Missions (1769-1800s)</h3><p>The mission system was Spain's centuries-old method of advancing and securing its colonial frontiers by Christianizing and Hispanicizing native peoples. Lacking sufficient settlers, Spain used natives to colonize new lands and provide a labor force to sustain its colonies. One photograph (from ca. 1910) shows an old adobe building in Santa Clara, one of several built in 1792-1800 as dwellings for the Indian families of Mission Santa Clara.</p><p>In their 60 years of operation, the 21 California missions had employed 142 priests and baptized 87,787 natives. Missions were at once churches, towns, schools, farms, factories, and prisons, often operated in conjunction with a nearby military presidio and agricultural pueblo.</p><p>But the vast lands controlled by the missions made them a target of Mexican republicans who, after gaining independence from Spain in 1821, began calling for the privatization of church property. Secularization began in 1834. Half of all mission lands were to be turned over to local native groups, but distribution was haphazard. Native Californians were often swindled out of the land or simply never told that they owned land; subsequently, many drifted away, strangers in their own ancestral homelands.</p><p>For Spaniards, however, the California frontier was a place where <span class=\"cite\">castas</span> (people of mixed ancestry) could move up the racial hierarchy. Over time, many Spanish families in California erased their African and indigenous ancestry by declaring themselves <span class=\"cite\">gente de raz\u00f3n</span>, people of reason \u2014 in explicit opposition to California's native peoples. Affluent Spanish families could even purchase certificates of their blood purity from Spain. Wealthy Spanish Californians also held themselves separate from the <span class=\"cite\">gente corriente</span>, working-class Spaniards who did not own their own land. The map of The United States of Mexico, shown here, illustrates how far Mexico's claims reached into what would later become of US state of California.</p><span class=\"cite\">castas</span><span class=\"cite\">gente de raz\u00f3n</span><span class=\"cite\">gente corriente</span><h3>The Rise and Fall of the Californios (1800s)</h3><p>The decline of the missions allowed for the rise of extensive ranching along the California coast and in the Sacramento Valley. To encourage agricultural development, the new Mexican government distributed more than 500 land grants to prominent families, using maps called <span class=\"cite\">dise\u00f1os</span> (like the colorful hand-drawn Dise\u00f1o del Rancho San Miguelito in Monterey, the Dise\u00f1o del Rancho de los Palos Verde, and the map of Rancho Petaluma) that roughly marked each grant's boundaries. This informal system of documentation would open the door to legal challenges by Americans after the US-Mexican War.</p><span class=\"cite\">dise\u00f1os</span><p>Well-connected families (such as the Vallejos, Alvarados, and Peraltas in the north and the Carillos, de la Guerras, and Picos in the south) could secure grants for each family member, creating an elite class of <span class=\"cite\">rancheros</span> who controlled hundreds of thousands of prime acres. Photographs of some of these powerful men include Jos\u00e9 Andres Sep\u00falveda, mayor of Los Angeles in 1837; Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo; a group picture of Pablo de la Guerra, Salvador Vallejo, and Andres Pico; and Pio Pico, the last Mexican Governor of California.</p><span class=\"cite\">rancheros</span><p>These families mainly raised cattle for an emerging hide-and-tallow trade with American ships that sold the hides to Boston tanneries and the tallow to South American candle and soap factories. The Californios held themselves apart from non-land-owning Mexicans and natives, intermarrying with each other and with the American and European entrepreneurs who began settling in California during the 1830s.</p><p>The US-Mexican War, however, reversed the fortunes of elite Californios, who slowly lost their power, authority, and land. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war, had granted Californios full US citizenship and promised that their property would be \"inviolably respected.\" But the informality of Mexican land grants made legal claims difficult when miners, squatters, and homesteaders overran Californios' lands, as the transcript of the legal challenge <span class=\"cite\">United States vs. Mariano G. Vallejo</span> makes clear. shown here. In the case, filed on May 31, 1852, Vallejo claimed ownership of 66,622.17 acres in Sonoma County, at Petaluma and near Sonoma. He finally won the case in 1874, 22 years later.</p><span class=\"cite\">United States vs. Mariano G. Vallejo</span><p>Even when Californio families won legal title to their lands, many found themselves bankrupt from attorney's fees or taxes. The Peralta family lost all but 700 of their 49,000 acres in the East Bay (encompassing the present-day cities of San Leandro, Alameda, Oakland, Piedmont, Emeryville, Berkeley, and Albany) to lawyers, taxes, squatters, and speculators. Eight Californios participated in the California constitutional convention of 1849, but over time their political power declined along with their land base.</p><h4>Romanticizing History</h4><p>Interestingly, during this period, Los Angeles boosters played up a mythical \"Spanish fantasy past.\" It popularized pastoral imagery of pious missionaries, quaint natives, and genteel Californios, and in some ways it persists to this day.</p><p>The oil painting <span class=\"cite\">Santa Clara Mission in 1849</span>, and the watercolor <span class=\"cite\">A California Magnate in His Home</span> (it is General Don Andres Pico) are good examples of this genre. Still, although certainly not entirely realistic, these scenes serve to give some idea of what life was like. The oil painting shows vaqueros on horseback, Indians in a wagon, and a priest at the gates of the mission itself. The watercolor shows the \"magnate\" (General Don Andres Pico) and probably his daughter in the corridor of a farm building (the ex-mission of San Fernando) with a musician, men and women, and animals. In the distance are an orchard and vaqueros lassoing cattle.</p><span class=\"cite\">Santa Clara Mission in 1849</span><span class=\"cite\">A California Magnate in His Home</span><p>These scenes portrayed a California that no longer existed (if, in fact, it ever did). The actual Mexican population continued to suffer from racism and was sequestered to a portion of Los Angeles known as Sonoratown (the area north of old Sunset Boulevard, east of Broadway, and west of North Main Street).</p><span class=\"h1-5\">California Content Standards</span>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic3a.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 64, "fields": {"title": "People", "slug": "people", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic show the faces of Japanese Americans before, during, and after incarceration. Most of the photographs were taken by War Relocation Authority (WRA) photographers for publicity purposes and tend to show people who are smiling or stoic. The paintings by internee artists Estelle Ishigo and Henry Sugimoto suggest a more emotional and somber mood.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the war, Japanese Americans largely lived in rural areas and in ethnic enclaves such as Los Angeles' Little Tokyo. The photograph of the \"Nisei queen\" shows people looking relaxed and happy, going about their daily lives. Some Japanese Americans worked in agriculture or blue-collar jobs, such as the former longshoreman pictured here; others owned or worked in businesses; still others were teachers, or artists, or homemakers, or students. The picture of the Mitarais before evacuation shows this successful farm operator and his wife and children looking much like any other pre-war middle-class family.  </p><p>During evacuation, Japanese Americans in the West were forced by government decree to leave their homes, businesses, jobs, school, and friends. The WRA photographs taken during the evacuation process show people waiting to be transported to the internment camps. The parents, grandparents, and children went as family groups. Many of the adults shown here are older adults and young women. In fact, a number of Japanese American men \u2014 like T/4 Taniguchi, shown with his wife and child, and the young man shown here in uniform \u2014 joined the US Army. One regiment, the Japanese American <a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic5f.html\">442nd Regimental Combat Team,</a>  was the most highly decorated American unit in WWII.</p><a href=\"/themed_collections/subtopic5f.html\">442nd Regimental Combat Team,</a><p>Most of the official photographs show calm, smiling, and happy internees, going about their daily lives: a woman knits in a room with her father, two women show each other their babies, and a little boy smiles for the camera, as do a group of orphans. A grandfather teaches his grandson to walk, a man supervises a camp agriculture product, a woman smiles with her bicycle, and everyone gathers to say hello to Eleanor Roosevelt on her visit to Gila Relocation Center. A camp \"Labor Day Queen\" happily eats an ice cream cone, in an echo of the pre-internment photograph of Little Tokyo's festival queen. The message sent by these photographs seems to be \"Life goes on as usual.\" </p><p>Internee art, however, tells a somewhat different story. Henry Sugimoto's painting <span class=\"cite\">Send Off Husband at Jerome Camp</span> shows a mother and child waving goodbye as their husband/father goes back to war. But unlike the photographs, which avoid images of forced confinement, this painting also shows a guard armed with a bayonet attached to a rifle, barring the family from leaving camp. A stop sign also blocks their way, and a guard tower is shown in the background. Estelle Ishigo's painting, in quiet brown tones, shows an interned mother and child looking out past barbed wire fences.</p><span class=\"cite\">Send Off Husband at Jerome Camp</span><p>After the war, families were released from the internment camps to resume their lives. The irony and poignancy of this time is reflected in Ishigo's sketch of her husband with the words \"Are We Americans Again?\" During resettlement, photographers seem to have been able to show Japanese Americans expressing a wider range of emotions. The image of people gathering to say goodbye to former internees who are being released shows one woman in tears. Still, most photographs show happy young faces, such as the Hiyashi family, who have resumed farming. The WRA is helping the Ikeyuchis (called \"loyal Americans\" in the caption, presumably because they were interned without incident), to find homes and jobs.</p><p>Many of the post-war WRA photographs make a point of the fact that Japanese Americans are being reintegrated into daily life. One blind veteran is surrounded by beautiful young women; Mr. and Mrs. Nishimura are back at work in their greenhouse and, according to the caption, \"things are working out fine\"; disabled veteran Isamu Oka and his family, interned at Heart Mountain in Wyoming, are now living in Los Gatos, where Oka is shown sitting in an orchard; and chrysanthemum specialist Ryohitsu Shibuya is back raising flowers in Mountain View, smiling despite the fact that he and his family are living in a small apartment and a packing shed while they wait to reclaim their apartment. Yet after the war, prejudice and discrimination still existed against Japanese Americans. Captain Daniel Inouye, who lost an arm in combat in Europe and would later become a US senator, recalled being turned away from a barber shop, even when he was dressed in his uniform<br/><br/>\n<span class=\"h1-5\">Selected Browse Terms</span></p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/jarda/browse/people.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 65, "fields": {"title": "Places", "slug": "places", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>From March 1942 to 1946, the US War Relocation Authority (WRA) had jurisdiction over the Japanese and Japanese Americans evacuated from their homes in California, Oregon, and Washington. The WRA photographs document the places that played a role in evacuation, relocation, incarceration, and resettlement \u2014 as the government wished to present them. Few, for example, show the barbed wire fences and guards that kept internees imprisoned. Although photographer Dorothea Lange also worked for the WRA, her images manage to suggest a more somber personal experience. In contrast, the paintings by internees portray the camps as experienced by the people who lived there.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>On December 7, 1941, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. The next day the United States declared war on Japan. A photograph taken at the time shows a Japanese-American-owned business with a sign hung by its owner, a UC graduate, proclaiming \"I am an American.\" By spring of 1942, \"all persons of Japanese ancestry\" living in California and other Western states were told to prepare to evacuate their homes by order of Executive Order 9066, signed into law by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  Two public posters, one in English and one in Japanese, explain the evacuation and assembly process.</p><p>Several photographs show Japanese American neighborhoods in San Francisco and Los Angeles during evacuation, when families were forced to leave their homes and businesses. In Florin, near Sacramento, children play in front of a Japanese-owned store two days before they will leave with their families for the assembly center.</p><p>Each person was only allowed to bring what he or she could carry, which meant leaving behind or selling homes, businesses, clothing, furniture, pets, and other possessions and personal items. Some families were able to store belongings elsewhere, as noted in the caption of the photograph of the Taisho Y.M. Hall. Many, however, lost everything. One photograph shows a Yugoslavian farmer who is taking over a berry farm formerly operated by residents of Japanese ancestry. Many families, outraged by the violation of their civil liberties, destroyed their property and possessions rather than selling them to unscrupulous buyers who would only offer a pittance.</p><p>Internees brought their luggage (shown here piled against a moving van, and waiting to be sorted at a relocation camp) to train and bus stations and waited to be transported to local assembly centers that were located at race tracks (as shown in Yoshiko Uchida's painting of Tanforan), stockyards and fairgrounds, and other large facilities. A WRA photograph taken in Los Angeles shows community members waving goodbye to a group of internees who are leaving on a bus. Henry Sugimoto's painting <span class=\"cite\">Take Fresh Air,</span> showing internees in transit being guarded by a ring of armed soldiers, is in stark contrast to the almost happy scene the government photograph depicts. At the assembly centers, they were dispersed to relocation camps across the West. One woman is shown standing in front of a list of family assignments, waiting to leave.</p><span class=\"cite\">Take Fresh Air,</span><p>The WRA administrated 10 fenced and guarded relocation camps in California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Texas, and Arkansas. One photograph shows a long line of people waiting to be admitted to Heart Mountain camp in Wyoming, which would soon become home to a large draft resistance movement. Another shows newcomers moving into Manzanar, in California's Owens Valley. As several images make clear, the relocation centers were barracks-like camps in remote desert or mountain areas. Paintings by Sugimoto, Hisako Hibi, and Estelle Ishigo (a European American who chose to be interned with her Japanese American husband) depict the camps as bleak, despite sometimes striking surroundings. Hibi's <span class=\"cite\">The 3rd Winter in Topaz</span> reflects the length of time internees endured these conditions.</p><span class=\"cite\">The 3rd Winter in Topaz</span><p>In December 1944, the WRA began a six-month process of releasing internees and shutting down the camps. In August 1945, the war was over. One photograph shows evacuees, still behind barbed wire, waving goodbye to friends who had been released. Several photographs show families returning home to Sacramento. Many of those who had no homes to return to were housed in yet another government facility, like the trailer city shown in the photograph of a resettlement camp in Burbank. By 1946, all of the camps were closed and the internees had been released to rebuild their lives.</p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/jarda/browse/places.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 66, "fields": {"title": "Daily Life", "slug": "daily-life", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>With thousands of residents, the internment camps inevitably became communities where families carried on with the details of daily life: adults worked, children went to school. This topic illustrates much of the daily life of internees, including camp administration, sleeping/eating/personal care, work, social life, study, events, relocation, and resettlement. The images show daily life as the government portrayed it in \"publicity\" photographs taken by government photographers, and through the art and camera lenses of the internees who lived it.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Because of the numbers involved \u2014 the Tanforan Assembly Center housed 8,000 people, for example \u2014 efficient administration was crucial. Several photographs show the government bureaucracy in action. A toddler is given a medical exam on entry; and Japanese American nurses are shown working in a clinic at Tanforan. Another photograph shows the housing office, where workers administered the day-to-day operation of the camps. A list of rules gives some idea of the restrictions placed on personal freedoms at the camps.</p><p>Two photographs show the interior spaces of barracks looking cramped and small. In one, cloth partitions are used to create private spaces, because entire families occupied one room. In the other, a man rests on a cot beneath his clothing, which hangs on a rope above his head. According to the caption, the government only supplied the cot and mattress. Three other WRA photographs show people living in exceptionally neat rooms, spacious by comparison. These are in stark contrast to Estelle Ishigo's brown-toned painting of a family around a table, <span class=\"cite\">At Home at Heart Mountain.</span></p><span class=\"cite\">At Home at Heart Mountain.</span><p>Meals were served cafeteria style. Two photographs show internees lining up for meals in the mess hall. According to one caption, they had to carry their own utensils and wash their own dishes back in their barracks. (Although these images show family groups eating together, historians and social scientists note that overall, family members tended to eat separately, weakening family ties.) Another photograph shows that evacuees worked preparing food for one camp in Arkansas.</p><p>Internee Henry Sugimoto's painting <span class=\"cite\">No Second Service</span> shows a family eating in the mess hall. Signs on the wall warn \"No second serving!\" and \"Milk for children and sick people only!\" In his diary, Sugimoto commented, \"They knew that the Japanese really liked rice, so rice was always part of the menu at least once a day. However, there were times when the rest of the meal didn't really go with rice. At times, there would be food that just wasn't appetizing at all, so you had to either try to eat at least one bite or just go without the meal.\"</p><span class=\"cite\">No Second Service</span><p>With so many people, privacy was an issue.

In addition to administrative jobs (such as nurses, office workers, and food service), internees also worked in the fields. Many of them, according to WRA captions, had also worked on farms before the war. The man shown feeding turkeys had owned and operated a turkey farm in Marysville for 26 years before internment. Another photograph shows the staff of the Pomona Center News, a camp newspaper (artist Estelle Ishigo is pictured second from right in the front row). Some adults, judged \"loyal\" by the US government, were released to work outside the camps due to wartime labor needs. A photograph taken at Granada Center shows residents registering at long tables.</p><p>Despite internment, daily life for children still consisted largely of school and play. Photographs show boys playing marbles, a girl on a swing, and children enjoying softball and basketball. A group of children walks through the muddy street to school during a rainstorm. High school in camp had many of the attributes of high school in peacetime. Images show a school band practice, a dance in the gym, and art classes. Other students just enjoy hanging out together on the campus. Several captions emphasize that internees served as teachers, and even earned teaching credentials in camp.</p><p>The small and large events of daily life also continued for adults. These photographs show women in a beauty salon, and a group of people forming a YMCA branch at camp. One couple is shown getting married at Santa Anita Assembly Center, looking happy despite the circumstances.  In another image, nurses hold babies born at the Tule Lake center. Inevitably, people died during internment. During the three years of its existence, the camp in Amache, Colorado, recorded 412 births and 107 deaths.</p><p>Some camps experienced resistance from internees. The photograph of a large number of people attending the funeral of James Wakasa in Topaz, Utah, is one example. Wakasa was shot and killed by a military sentry who claimed he was trying to escape. Residents demanded an investigation and a funeral outdoors, on the spot where he was killed. When their demands were refused, they stopped work in protest. Even after the funeral was allowed, the work stoppage continued. Eventually, the sentry was court-martialed and found not guilty. To prevent more protests, the government censored this from being reported in the camp newspaper.</p><p>When the war ended, the bureaucracy continued as interned citizens were released and resettled. The government hoped to disperse Japanese Americans throughout the country to prevent the emergence of Japanese ethnic enclaves. Scenes of assembly were now reversed. \"Moving day at the Jerome Center\" shows belongings being removed from barracks and loaded onto trucks. Another photo shows crowds waving goodbye as former camp residents board a train leaving the camp at Heart Mountain, Wyoming, and heading to postwar life.<br/><br/>\n<span class=\"h1-5\">Selected Browse Terms</span></p>", "render_as": "H", "publish": false, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/jarda/browse/daily-life.html", "hero": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 67, "fields": {"title": "Personal Experiences", "slug": "personal-experiences", "blockquote": "", "about_exhibit": "", "essay": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic were created by men, women, and youth during their incarceration in relocation camps. Artists expressed the internal experience of camp life in paintings and drawings. Writings \u2014 including memoirs, illustrated diaries, scrapbooks, and letters home \u2014 reflect the daily struggle of men, women, and children trying to live \"normal\" lives in remote, guarded camps behind barbed wire. These personal creations express experiences that are often more emotionally complex than the official government photographs. The images in this topic depict reality through the eyes of Japanese Americans, reflecting a mix of emotions, including anger, uncertainty, and hope.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The first image shows Estelle (Peck) Ishigo, a European American artist born in Oakland, California, who chose to be interned in Wyoming\u2019s remote Lone Heart Mountain Relocation Center with her Japanese American husband rather than endure separation. Her vivid personal memoir, <span class=\"cite\">Lone Heart Mountain,</span> and somber paintings, reflect the struggle of many families to stay together despite hardship.</p><span class=\"cite\">Lone Heart Mountain,</span><p>Colorful paintings by Henry Sugimoto, interned in Arkansas' Camp Jerome, express the anger and sadness of evacuation and relocation. In <span class=\"cite\">Junkshop Man Took Away Our Icebox,</span> an evacuated family is forced to sell their possessions. <span class=\"cite\">Goodbye My Son</span> illustrates the sad departure from the camp of a young Japanese American who enlisted in the US Army \u2014 a common event. Ironically, even as the US government denied nisei men their civil liberties, they asked them to fight in the war, identifying \"loyal\" internees through a controversial questionnaire. One question, for example, asked draft-age men if they were willing to serve in the US armed forces on combat duty, wherever ordered. Another question asked everyone in camp if they would swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of America and forswear allegiance and obedience to Japan or any other foreign government or organization. Even release from the camps was bittersweet for Sugimoto. His painting <span class=\"cite\">Freedom Day Came</span> is a self-portrait of the artist contemplating a caged bird.</p><span class=\"cite\">Junkshop Man Took Away Our Icebox,</span><span class=\"cite\">Goodbye My Son</span><span class=\"cite\">Freedom Day Came</span><p>Tension between so-called loyal and disloyal internees sometimes erupted into violence. Sugimoto's 1943 painting <span class=\"cite\">Rev. Yamazaki Was Beaten in Camp Jerome</span> documents an attack on Reverend John Yamazaki, suspected by other internees of conspiring with the government because he translated government documents into Japanese for the non-English-speaking population. In the left-hand corner is a poem composed by Yamazaki in response to the beating.</p><span class=\"cite\">Rev. Yamazaki Was Beaten in Camp Jerome</span><p>In the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, Sugimoto (the son of a samurai) revisited his camp experience in a series of paintings called \"Re-envisioning History.\" His long career as a painter spanned California, Paris, Mexico, and two World War II internment camps in Arkansas. He died in 1990 in New York City\u2019s Harlem, where he had lived for more than 20 years.</p><p>Painter Hisako Hibi (shown in <span class=\"cite\">Study for a Self Portrait</span>) taught art during her incarceration in Tanforan and Topaz, Utah, and often portrayed the effect of camp life on mothers and children, as in the painting <span class=\"cite\">With Mother</span>. In <span class=\"cite\">Laundry Room,</span> mothers bathe their children in laundry sinks because the few bathtubs were almost always occupied. In <span class=\"cite\">A Letter,</span> a woman reads a letter that begins \"Dear Mother,\" possibly from a son who had joined the US Army or a child who had been relocated outside the camps. (Some young people were allowed to leave the West Coast and go to college in other parts of the United States; others were allowed to work at agricultural jobs.) The painting also gives a glimpse of living quarters, including a pot-bellied stove, laundry hanging to dry, and a child\u2019s drawing pinned to the wall.</p><span class=\"cite\">Study for a Self Portrait</span><span class=\"cite\">With Mother</span><span class=\"cite\">Laundry Room,</span><span class=\"cite\">A Letter,</span><p>Artist and writer Yoshiko Uchida was born in Alameda, California, and graduated from UC Berkeley (she received her diploma at Tanforan Relocation Center, where she was housed in a former horse stall). She spent a year at Topaz with her family before being allowed to complete her education at Smith College in Massachusetts. She is shown with her family, in a photograph taken the day they were freed.</p><p>After the war, Uchida wrote a number of successful children's books about Japanese experiences, culture, and folklore. The watercolors shown here depict the remote surroundings of Topaz. Contrast her <span class=\"cite\">Untitled Camp Scene (Water Tank)</span> with a government-issued postcard showing the barracks but not the barbed wire fence surrounding it. Uchida's illustrated diaries include drawings and descriptions of daily life, and express the young woman's hope for freedom and peace. Her scrapbook collects items of daily life, including a pamphlet outlining government expectations for internees. The cover captures the young woman\u2019s uncertainty about her future.</p><span class=\"cite\">Untitled Camp Scene (Water Tank)</span><p>Her father, Dwight Uchida, was born in Japan, but had lived in California for many years. At the time of Pearl Harbor, he was a manager at a San Francisco trading company. His drawings show an older man\u2019s view of camp life. Although the letter to his family puts a good face on his experiences, he \u2014 like many Issei \u2014  never really recovered from the stress of incarceration and was troubled throughout his life.</p><p>Stanley Hayami, a student from Los Angeles, attended high school at Heart Mountain. The pages from his diary, written when he was 16 to 18, record his dreams of becoming an artist-writer, and doubts ranging from the quality of his schoolwork to the meaning of democracy. His drawing of the homes he lived in between 1934 and 1943 makes clear just how much his life had changed. In June 1944, at age 19, Hayami joined the US Army and was killed in combat in Northern Italy on April 23, 1945, while trying to help a fellow soldier.</p><p>Moriyuki Shimada's photograph album shows a young man's view of camp life \u2014 mostly friends, pretty girls, and sports teams. Shimada, pictured here, was 22 when he and his family were forcibly removed from their home in Santa Clara, California, to Heart Mountain.</p><p>The Aquila High School yearbook pictures graduating seniors from high school at the Tule Lake, California, camp. It seems much like other high school yearbooks of the 1940s. Janet Matsuda's poem \"Out of the Gloom,\" expressing the hope that light will come out of the darkness where \"the flower of hope refuses to bloom,\" probably reflects the mood of students unsure of what the future holds. Contrast this with non-internee Claire Sprague's cheerful letter to the <span class=\"cite\">Saturday Evening Post</span> about the new life of her former students.</p><span class=\"cite\">Saturday

The next day, the United States and Britain declared war on Japan. Two months later, on February 19, 1942, the lives of thousands of Japanese \r\nAmericans \r\nwere dramatically changed when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 (<a href=\"javascript:MM_openBrWindow()\">view the Order</a>). This order led to the assembly and evacuation and \r\nrelocation of nearly 122,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry on the west coast of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Racism and Prejudice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to note that, despite the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans in Hawaii were not incarcerated en masse. Of the total Japanese American population in Hawaii-which made up \r\nnearly 40% of the population of Hawaii itself, and a large portion of the skilled workforce-only a few thousand people were detained. The fact that so few Japanese Americans were  incarcerated in \r\nHawaii suggests that their mass removal on the West Coast was racially motivated rather than born of \"military necessity.\" Agricultural interest groups in western states and many local politicians had \r\nlong been opposed to the presence of Japanese Americans and used the attack on Pearl Harbor to step up calls for their removal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States was fighting the war on three fronts \u2014 Japan, Germany, and Italy \u2014 compared to the number of Japanese Americans, a relatively small number of Germans and Italians were interned in the United States. But although Executive Order 9066 was written in vague terms that did not specify an ethnicity, it was used for the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans. The government claimed that incarceration was for military necessity and, ironically, to \"protect\" Japanese Americans from racist retribution they might face as a result of Pearl Harbor. (These reasons were later proved false by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians in the 1980s.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Japanese Americans and other Asian Americans had long been characterized as a foreign \"Yellow Peril\" that was a threat to the United States. Prejudice against Japanese Americans, including laws preventing them from owning land, existed long before World War II. Even though Japanese Americans largely considered themselves loyal and even patriotic Americans, suspicions about their loyalties were pervasive. Before Pearl Harbor was bombed, President Roosevelt secretly commissioned Curtis Munson, a businessman, to assess the possibility that Japanese Americans would pose a threat to US security. Munson\u2019s report found (as cited in Ronald Takaki, <span class=\"cite\">Strangers from a Distant Shore,</span> page 386) that \"There will be no armed uprising of Japanese\" in the United States. \"For the most part,\" the report says, \"the local Japanese are loyal to the United States or, at worst, hope that by remaining quiet they can avoid concentration camps or irresponsible mobs.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these findings, however, thousands of families in California, Oregon, and Washington were soon incarcerated in government camps. The government \u2014 and popular sentiment \u2014 understood that German Americans were not necessarily Nazi sympathizers, and could distinguish Italian Americans from Mussolini\u2019s Fascist regime, but they had a more difficult time separating Japanese Americans from Imperial Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of those interned \u2014 nearly 70,000, over 60% \u2014 were American citizens.  Many of the rest were long-time US residents who had lived in this country between 20 and 40 years. By and large, most Japanese Americans, particularly the Nisei (the first generation born in the United States), considered themselves loyal Americans. No Japanese American or Japanese national was ever found guilty of sabotage or espionage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Camps</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>From March 1942 to 1946, the US War Relocation Authority (WRA) had jurisdiction over the Japanese and Japanese Americans evacuated from their homes in California, Oregon, and Washington. It administered the extensive resettlement program, and oversaw the details of the registration and segregation programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Evacuated\" families left behind homes, businesses, pets, land, and most of their belongings. Taking only what they could carry, Japanese Americans were taken by bus and train to assembly centers \u2014 hastily converted facilities such as race tracks and fairgrounds. Here they awaited reassignment to the \"relocation camps.\"</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The WRA controlled the administration of 10 camps in remote areas of California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Texas, and Arkansas. Although official government photographs were careful not to show it, these facilities were fenced with barbed wire and guarded by armed soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During internment (also called incarceration), families worked, studied, and lived their lives in the barracks-like living quarters of the relocation centers, which were alternately labeled \"relocation camps,\" \"concentration camps,\" or \"evacuation centers.\" These camps, some of which housed approximately 8,000 people, functioned as communities. The government provided medical care, schools, and food, and adults often held camp jobs \u2014 in food service, agriculture, medical clinics, as teachers, and other jobs required for daily life.</p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Postwar \"Resettlement\"</h4> \r\n\r\n<p>In December 1944, President Roosevelt rescinded Executive Order 9066, and the WRA began a six-month process of releasing internees (often to \"resettlement\" facilities and temporary housing) and shutting down the camps. In August 1945, the war was over. By 1946, the camps were closed and all of the internees had been released to rebuild their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the postwar years, these Japanese Americans had to rebuild their lives. The US citizens and long-time residents who had been incarcerated had lost their personal liberties, and many also lost their homes, businesses, property, and savings. Individuals born in Japan were not allowed to become naturalized US citizens until 1952.</p>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n <h4>Chronology of World War II and Japanese American Incarceration</h4>\r\n \r\n  \r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"left\">December 7, 1941</td>\r\n    <td class=\"right\">Japan bombs Pearl Harbor.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"left\">December 8, 1941</td>\r\n    <td class=\"right\">United States and Britain declare war on Japan.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"left\">February 19, 1942</td>\r\n    <td class=\"right\">President Roosevelt signs Executive Order 9066.
