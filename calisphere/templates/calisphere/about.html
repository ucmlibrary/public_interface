		<p>Welcome to Calisphere: your gateway to California’s remarkable digital collections. Calisphere provides free access to unique and historically important artifacts for research, teaching, and curious exploration. Discover over 400,000 photographs, documents, letters, artwork, diaries, oral histories, films, advertisements, musical recordings, and more.</p>

		<p>The collections on Calisphere have been digitized and contributed by <a href="/institutions/uc-partners/" data-pjax="js-pageContent">all ten campuses of the University of California</a> and other important <a href="/institutions/statewide-partners/" data-pjax="js-pageContent">libraries, archives, and museums throughout the state</a>.</p>
		
		<p>For more information about how to use Calisphere and the materials you find here, please consult the <a href="/help/" data-pjax="js-pageContent">help page</a> and <a href="/terms/" data-pjax="js-pageContent">terms of use</a>.</p>

		<h2>Calisphere <span class="text-uppercase">beta</span>: you are here</h2>

		<p>Calisphere <span class="text-uppercase">beta</span> is the latest version of the Calisphere website. It has more content than ever before and new features to help you hone in on the materials you need. And now you can use it on your tablet or mobile device, too.</p>
		
		<p>This site is in “beta” mode because we’re still actively developing it&mdash;but we couldn’t wait any longer to share it with you. We'll be adding more collections and functionality over the coming months, with the goal of replacing the old site in late 2016.</p>
		
		<p>What do you think of the new Calisphere? <a href="/contact/" data-pjax="js-pageContent">We’d welcome your feedback</a>.</p>

<h2>Where are the themed collections?</h2>

		<p>If you’re a longtime Calisphere visitor, you may notice the absence of Themed Collections, the Japanese American Relocation Digital Archives (JARDA), California Cultures, and Local History Mapped. We're working on adding these to the new site, plus creating more special topics like them. In the meantime, you can access them on <a href="http://www.calisphere.org">the old Calisphere website</a>, or learn more about them here on the <a href="/collections/themed/" data-pjax="js-pageContent">collections page</a> before making the jump.</p>
	<h2>Our organization</h2>

		<p>Calisphere is a project of the <a href="http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu">University of California Libraries</a>, developed and maintained by the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org">California Digital Library</a>. For more information about Calisphere <span class="text-uppercase">beta</span> and its underlying technical architecture, <a href="https://registry.cdlib.org/documentation/">visit our documentation site</a>.</p>
