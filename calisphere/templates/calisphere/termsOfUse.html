		<h2>Where to go for more information</h2>

		<p>Calisphere contains a wide variety of items from many different institutions. Some items are in the public domain and may be freely used by anyone; for some items the contributing institution is the copyright holder and may grant permission for certain uses; at other times the copyright owner is a third party or is unknown and users will need to conduct their own analysis and may need to contact a copyright holder directly. To learn more about an item, users can consult the item level information and contact the contributing institution by clicking on the “contact owner” button or visiting their institution page for phone and email information.</p>

		<h2>If you have more information about something on the site</h2>

		<p>The nature of historical, archival, and/or primary source archival and manuscript collections and other primary source collections often can makes it difficult to determine details about the items that appear on this site. The California Digital Library and the contributing institution provide as much information as possible available, in the metadata associated with digital images, texts, and audio and video recordings, in accordance with commonly-accepted community standards and best practices. However, due to the limited resources available for investigating individual items and describing them fully, records may lack accurate and/or complete information about facts such as item’s exact age, persons or places depicted, creator, or copyright status.</p>

		<p>If you have information about an item on this site that is not represented in the item’s metadata or would like to help correct an error, please contact the contributing institution by clicking on the “contact owner” button or visiting their institution page for phone and email information.</p>
